        <p>The Statutory Audit is one of the most important compliance requirements for companies and other specified entities in India. Mandated by law — primarily the Companies Act — a statutory audit provides an independent, professional verification that the financial statements of an entity give a true and fair view of its financial position and performance. Understanding what statutory audit involves, who conducts it, and what it covers helps businesses prepare better and build stakeholder confidence. This guide explains everything about statutory audit in India.</p>

        <h2 id="what-is">1. What is a Statutory Audit?</h2>
        <p>A Statutory Audit is a legally mandated examination of a company's financial records, books of accounts, and financial statements by an independent Chartered Accountant (the Statutory Auditor), appointed as per the provisions of the Companies Act. The auditor's objective is to express an independent opinion on whether the financial statements present a true and fair view of the company's financial position and performance, and whether they comply with applicable accounting standards and legal requirements.</p>
        <p>The audit report issued by the statutory auditor is a critical document — it accompanies the financial statements filed with the MCA (Ministry of Corporate Affairs) in the Annual Return, and is reviewed by banks, investors, regulators, and other stakeholders as an independent validation of the company's financial health.</p>

        <h2 id="who-needs">2. Who Requires a Statutory Audit?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>All Companies (Private and Public):</strong> Every company registered under the Companies Act — private limited, public limited, Section 8 (NGO), OPC (One Person Company) — is required to have its accounts audited by a statutory auditor every year.</li>
            <li><strong>LLPs (above threshold):</strong> Limited Liability Partnerships with turnover exceeding ₹40 lakh or contribution exceeding ₹25 lakh in any financial year must get their accounts audited.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooperative Societies:</strong> Covered under respective state cooperative society Acts — audit is mandatory.</li>
            <li><strong>Banks, Insurance Companies, and NBFCs:</strong> Subject to statutory audit under their respective governing laws (Banking Regulation Act, IRDA regulations, RBI circulars).</li>
            <li><strong>Trusts and Societies:</strong> NGOs and charitable trusts receiving government grants or above-threshold donations are often required to have their accounts audited under the relevant state Trust Act.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="appointment">3. Appointment of Statutory Auditor</h2>
        <p>The statutory auditor of a company is appointed by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting (AGM). Key rules under the Companies Act:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>First Auditor:</strong> Appointed by the Board of Directors within 30 days of incorporation. Holds office until the conclusion of the first AGM.</li>
            <li><strong>Subsequent Auditors:</strong> Appointed by shareholders at AGM for a term of 5 consecutive years — subject to ratification at each AGM.</li>
            <li><strong>Rotation (Large Companies):</strong> Listed companies and certain other large companies must rotate their auditors every 5–10 years — an individual CA cannot continue as auditor for more than 5 consecutive years; a CA firm cannot continue for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li><strong>Independence:</strong> The auditor must be independent — cannot be a director, officer, or employee of the company, or have any financial interest in the company.</li>
            <li><strong>ADT-1 Filing:</strong> The company must file Form ADT-1 with the MCA within 15 days of auditor appointment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="scope">4. Scope of Statutory Audit — What the Auditor Examines</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Books of Accounts:</strong> Verification that proper books have been maintained as per legal requirements — cash book, bank book, ledger, journal, stock register, fixed asset register.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Statements:</strong> Examination of Balance Sheet, P&amp;L Account, Cash Flow Statement, and Notes to Accounts for accuracy, completeness, and compliance with Schedule III / applicable Accounting Standards (AS or Ind AS).</li>
            <li><strong>Internal Controls:</strong> Assessment of the company's internal control systems — particularly over financial reporting, cash handling, procurement, and payroll.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance Verification:</strong> Checking compliance with Companies Act provisions — meetings held, resolutions passed, related-party transactions disclosed, loans to directors, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>CARO (Companies Auditor's Report Order):</strong> Applicable to most companies — a detailed report covering fixed assets, inventory, loans, statutory dues, fraud, and more — prepared as part of the audit report.</li>
            <li><strong>Substantive Procedures:</strong> Verification of specific balances and transactions — debtors confirmation, stock verification, bank confirmations, legal expense reviews, sampling of invoices.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box">
            <p>&#128204; <strong>CARO 2020</strong> requires auditors to report on 21 specific matters including fraud detection, whistle-blower complaints, CSR spending, and NBFCs classification — making statutory audit far more rigorous than before. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20want%20to%20understand%20CARO%202020%20requirements%20for%20my%20company" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Discuss CARO compliance with our CA</a></p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="report">5. The Statutory Audit Report</h2>
        <p>The audit report contains the auditor's opinion on the financial statements. Types of audit opinions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unmodified (Clean) Opinion:</strong> The financial statements give a true and fair view — the best outcome for a company.</li>
            <li><strong>Qualified Opinion:</strong> The statements give a true and fair view except for a specific matter — the auditor has a reservation on one or more issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Adverse Opinion:</strong> The financial statements do not give a true and fair view — a serious red flag for stakeholders.</li>
            <li><strong>Disclaimer of Opinion:</strong> The auditor is unable to form an opinion due to significant limitations in the scope of audit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="timeline">6. Statutory Audit Timeline and Deadlines</h2>
