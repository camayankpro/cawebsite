        <p>GST Registration Cancellation — whether voluntary (you want to close the registration) or department-initiated (for non-compliance) — involves specific procedures, final return filing, reversal of ITC on remaining stock, and payment of tax. Understanding this process correctly prevents post-cancellation demands and complications. This guide covers everything about GST cancellation and revocation.</p>

        <h2 id="voluntary">1. Voluntary GST Cancellation — When and Why</h2>
        <p>You can voluntarily cancel your GST registration if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your turnover has fallen below the mandatory threshold and you no longer want to remain registered</li>
            <li>You have closed, sold, or transferred your business</li>
            <li>Your business structure has changed (e.g., proprietorship merged into company — new registration taken)</li>
            <li>You have discontinued the taxable supply of goods or services</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Voluntarily registered businesses can cancel only after 1 year from the effective date of registration.</p>

        <h2 id="dept-cancel">2. Department-Initiated GST Cancellation</h2>
        <p>The GST officer can cancel your registration (after issuing Show Cause Notice in Form REG-17) if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have not filed GST returns for 6 consecutive months (monthly filers) or 3 tax periods (quarterly filers)</li>
            <li>You have obtained registration through fraud, misrepresentation, or suppression of facts</li>
            <li>You are conducting business from an address not declared or not existing</li>
            <li>You are not conducting any business from the declared principal place of business</li>
            <li>You have issued invoices without making actual supply (fake invoicing)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="mini-cta"><p>Received a GST cancellation notice (REG-17)? You have a right to respond and prevent cancellation. Act immediately.</p><a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20received%20a%20GST%20cancellation%20notice%20and%20need%20urgent%20help">Respond to Cancellation Notice &#8594;</a></div>

        <h2 id="gstr10">4. GSTR-10 — Final Return After Cancellation</h2>
        <p>GSTR-10 is the final return that every cancelled GST taxpayer must file within 3 months of the effective date of cancellation. It requires disclosure of: closing stock of inputs, semi-finished goods, and finished goods as of the cancellation date; ITC availed on such stock; and payment of tax on the higher of tax on inputs or market value at applicable rate. <strong>Non-filing of GSTR-10 attracts a penalty of ₹200/day</strong> after a notice period — and is a very common post-cancellation compliance failure.</p>

        <h2 id="revocation">5. Revocation of Cancellation</h2>
        <p>If your registration was cancelled by the department — you can apply for revocation in Form REG-21 within 90 days (extendable by officer/commissioner up to 180 days further) from the cancellation order. For revocation: file all pending returns, pay all outstanding tax, interest, and penalties, and then apply for revocation with satisfactory explanation. Our CA team handles the end-to-end revocation process — pending return filing, payment calculation, and revocation application.</p>
