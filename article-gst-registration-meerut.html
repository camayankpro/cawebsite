        <p>Meerut is one of western Uttar Pradesh's most commercially active cities — home to one of India's largest sports goods clusters in <strong>Partapur</strong>, a thriving silver jewellery market in <strong>Sadar Bazar</strong>, sugarcane-based industries along the <strong>Mawana Road</strong>, educational institutions in <strong>Shastri Nagar</strong>, and a rapidly growing IT and services sector. If you run a business in Meerut, <strong>GST Registration</strong> is not just a compliance requirement — it is a fundamental business necessity. Our CA team at <strong>TaxAMC</strong> provides expert GST Registration services across all areas of Meerut district.</p>

        <h2 id="who-needs">1. Who Must Register for GST in Meerut?</h2>
        <p>As per the GST Act, 2017, the following businesses in Meerut must mandatorily register for GST:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Turnover threshold:</strong> Annual turnover above ₹40 lakh for goods suppliers; above ₹20 lakh for service providers in Uttar Pradesh</li>
            <li><strong>Interstate suppliers:</strong> Meerut businesses supplying goods or services to Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, or any other state — regardless of turnover</li>
            <li><strong>E-commerce sellers:</strong> All sellers on Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, Myntra — mandatory regardless of annual turnover</li>
            <li><strong>Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM):</strong> Businesses receiving specified supplies on which they must pay GST under RCM</li>
            <li><strong>Sports goods exporters (Partapur):</strong> Exporters must register to avail zero-rated supply benefits and LUT filing</li>
            <li><strong>Agents of registered suppliers</strong> operating in Meerut</li>
            <li><strong>Input Service Distributors (ISD)</strong> and businesses liable for TDS/TCS under GST</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even below the threshold, <strong>voluntary GST registration</strong> is advisable for B2B businesses in Meerut's manufacturing and trading clusters — unregistered suppliers cannot issue tax invoices, blocking buyers' ITC claims.</p>

        <h2 id="penalty">7. Penalty for Non-Registration</h2>
        <p>Operating without GST registration when mandatory attracts a penalty of <strong>10% of tax due (minimum ₹10,000)</strong>. In cases of deliberate evasion, <strong>100% of the tax amount</strong>. Invoices raised without GSTIN are invalid for ITC — your buyers cannot claim credit on their purchases from you, which regularly costs businesses their biggest clients.</p>

        <div class="box warn"><p>&#9888;&#65039; <strong>Important for Meerut businesses:</strong> GST registration is required <em>before</em> making your first taxable supply — not after crossing the turnover threshold. Retrospective registration demands include penalties on all past supplies. Register now — it is free.</p></div>
