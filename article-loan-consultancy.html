    <p>Getting a business loan from a bank in India can feel complicated — with documentation requirements, eligibility criteria, collateral demands, and processing delays. Yet for most businesses, bank finance is the cheapest and most appropriate source of funds. The difference between approval and rejection often comes down to how well you understand the bank&#39;s assessment criteria and how well you prepare your application. This guide explains everything you need to know to get the right loan for your business.</p>

    <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Planning to apply for a business loan?</strong> Our CA team helps businesses assess loan eligibility, prepare documentation, approach the right lenders, and present their case effectively — for businesses in Hapur, Ghaziabad, Meerut, NCR, UP, and pan-India. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20business%20loan%20consultancy%20and%20documentation%20support" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

    <h2 id="types">1. Types of Business Loans in India</h2>
    <table class="table">
      <tr><th>Loan Type</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Collateral</th><th>Typical Tenure</th></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Term Loan</strong></td><td>Capital expenditure — machinery, equipment, vehicles, office setup</td><td>Asset being financed + additional collateral often required</td><td>3–7 years EMI</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Working Capital Loan (CC/OD)</strong></td><td>Day-to-day operations — inventory, debtors</td><td>Stock + debtors as primary security; property as collateral</td><td>Revolving — annual renewal</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>MSME Loan (CGTMSE)</strong></td><td>Term loan or WC — no collateral required</td><td>CGTMSE guarantee covers bank — no property needed</td><td>3–5 years</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Loan Against Property (LAP)</strong></td><td>Any business purpose — funded against property</td><td>Property (residential or commercial)</td><td>5–15 years</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Machinery Loan / Equipment Finance</strong></td><td>Specific machinery or equipment purchase</td><td>Machinery being financed (hypothecation)</td><td>3–5 years</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h2 id="eligibility">2. Key Eligibility Factors Banks Check</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Business vintage:</strong> Most banks prefer 2–3 years of operations. New businesses should approach MUDRA, CGTMSE, or SIDBI instead.</li>
      <li><strong>ITR-based income:</strong> Banks assess income based on ITR — income shown in ITR = income you can borrow against. Low income in ITR = low loan eligibility. This is the single most common reason for lower-than-needed sanctions.</li>
      <li><strong>CIBIL score:</strong> Promoter personal CIBIL should be 700+; company CIBIL (CMR rating) should be healthy. Clean repayment history is critical.</li>
      <li><strong>GST turnover:</strong> Banks cross-verify your turnover against GST returns — GSTR-3B turnover should match financial statements</li>
      <li><strong>Bank account activity:</strong> Healthy current account transactions with regular credits and debits. Cash deposits raise red flags for banks.</li>
      <li><strong>Existing debt:</strong> DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) = Net Cash Accrual / Total Debt Repayment obligation — banks want DSCR &gt; 1.25</li>
      <li><strong>Collateral:</strong> For secured loans — property value must cover loan amount with adequate margin (typically loan = 60–75% of property value)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="mistakes">3. Common Mistakes That Lead to Loan Rejection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low income in ITR:</strong> Years of minimising taxable income means the bank sees a low-income business unworthy of a large loan</li>
      <li><strong>Mismatch between GST turnover and financial statements:</strong> Bank computers flag this and it triggers manual scrutiny</li>
      <li><strong>Approaching the wrong bank:</strong> PSU banks like SBI have different (usually easier) criteria for MSME loans versus private banks. Some banks specialise in your industry.</li>
      <li><strong>Incomplete documentation:</strong> Missing ITR computation, no GSTR reconciliation, outdated balance sheets</li>
      <li><strong>Poor current account behaviour:</strong> Cheque bounces, irregular deposits, no business transactions in account</li>
      <li><strong>Multiple recent credit enquiries:</strong> Too many simultaneous loan applications damage CIBIL score</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="mini-cta"><p>The most effective thing you can do before applying for a business loan is to review your last 3 years of ITRs and ensure your income is properly declared and consistent. Our CA team can audit your financial profile and advise on loan readiness.</p><a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20a%20loan%20eligibility%20assessment%20for%20my%20business">Loan Eligibility Assessment &#8594;</a></div>

    <h2 id="improve">4. How to Improve Your Loan Eligibility</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Declare correct income in ITR:</strong> Consistent and accurate income declaration builds a bankable profile over 2–3 years</li>
      <li><strong>Maintain current account hygiene:</strong> All business receipts through current account; avoid cash; maintain average monthly balance</li>
      <li><strong>Clear existing defaults:</strong> Clear any overdue payments, bounce history, or NPA status before applying</li>
      <li><strong>Build business credit:</strong> Use a business credit card, pay on time — builds CMR (Company Credit Report)</li>
      <li><strong>Get MSME registration (Udyam):</strong> Opens access to priority sector lending, CGTMSE guarantee, and interest subsidies</li>
      <li><strong>Maintain proper books and get accounts audited:</strong> Audited financials significantly improve credibility with banks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="process">5. Loan Application Process — Step by Step</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1 — Assess need and type:</strong> How much do you need? Term loan or working capital? What can you offer as collateral?</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2 — Check eligibility:</strong> Review ITR income, CIBIL, and existing obligations with a CA</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3 — Prepare documentation:</strong> ITR, audited financials, GST returns, bank statements, KYC, business proof, property documents if collateral</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4 — Prepare CMA data and project report:</strong> For loans above ₹25 lakh</li>
      <li><strong>Step 5 — Approach bank:</strong> Meet the branch manager or relationship manager — relationship matters in bank lending</li>
      <li><strong>Step 6 — Application processing:</strong> Bank conducts field verification, valuation of collateral, and credit appraisal</li>
      <li><strong>Step 7 — Sanction and disbursement:</strong> Sanction letter → loan agreement → security creation → disbursement</li>
    </ul>
