  <div class="content">
    <p>Agreements and contracts are the foundation of every business relationship — with partners, investors, employees, clients, and vendors. In India, verbal agreements are legally enforceable in theory but nearly impossible to prove in practice. A well-drafted written agreement protects your interests, defines each party&#39;s rights and obligations, and provides a clear path for dispute resolution. This guide covers the key legal agreements every business in India needs.</p>

    <h2 id="partnership">1. Partnership Deed — Key Clauses and Requirements</h2>
    <p>A Partnership Deed (also called Partnership Agreement) is the foundational document for a Partnership Firm in India. While a verbal partnership is technically valid under the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, a written partnership deed is essential for practical purposes — bank account opening, GST registration, dispute resolution, and legal proof.</p>
    <p><strong>Mandatory contents of a Partnership Deed:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name and address of the firm and all partners</li>
      <li>Nature of business</li>
      <li>Date of commencement</li>
      <li>Capital contribution by each partner</li>
      <li>Profit/loss sharing ratio</li>
      <li>Salary/remuneration of working partners (important for income tax deduction under Section 40(b))</li>
      <li>Interest on capital and drawings</li>
      <li>Duties, powers, and obligations of each partner</li>
      <li>Admission, retirement, and death of a partner</li>
      <li>Dissolution procedure</li>
      <li>Dispute resolution (arbitration clause recommended)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Stamp duty:</strong> Partnership deeds must be stamped under the Stamp Act — stamp duty varies by state and the value of capital contribution. In UP, stamp duty on partnership deed is ₹1,500.</p>

    <h2 id="sha">2. Shareholders Agreement (SHA) — What It Covers</h2>
    <p>A Shareholders Agreement is a private contract between the shareholders of a company — it supplements the AOA and governs the relationship between shareholders, especially in multi-founder companies and investor-funded startups.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Share transfer restrictions:</strong> Right of first refusal, right of first offer, drag-along and tag-along rights, lock-in periods</li>
      <li><strong>Board composition:</strong> Who can nominate directors, quorum for board meetings, reserved matters requiring investor consent</li>
      <li><strong>Anti-dilution protection:</strong> Investor protection against future down-round dilution</li>
      <li><strong>ESOP pool:</strong> Size of employee stock option pool and vesting schedule</li>
      <li><strong>Founder vesting:</strong> 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff for founders</li>
      <li><strong>Information rights:</strong> Investor rights to quarterly/annual financial statements</li>
      <li><strong>Exit mechanisms:</strong> IPO timeline, strategic sale, buyback provisions</li>
      <li><strong>Dispute resolution:</strong> Arbitration clause, governing law</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="mini-cta"><p>A shareholders agreement drafted at incorporation is far cheaper and less contentious than one negotiated later during a dispute.

    <h2 id="nda">3. NDA and Confidentiality Agreements</h2>
    <p>An NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) protects confidential business information — trade secrets, technology, client lists, pricing — shared with employees, consultants, vendors, or potential investors.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unilateral NDA:</strong> One party discloses, other party bound — common in vendor/consultant relationships and investor disclosures</li>
      <li><strong>Mutual NDA:</strong> Both parties disclose — common in partnership/JV discussions</li>
      <li><strong>Key clauses:</strong> Definition of confidential information (be precise — don&#39;t over-include or under-include), exclusions from confidentiality (already public info, independently developed info), obligations of receiving party, duration (typically 2–5 years), remedies (injunction + damages), return/destruction of information</li>
      <li>Under Indian Contract Act, NDAs are enforceable — but they must have adequate consideration and defined scope to be effective</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="employment">4. Employment Agreements and Offer Letters</h2>
    <p>Every employee should have a written appointment letter or employment agreement covering:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designation, reporting structure, and job description</li>
      <li>CTC breakup (basic, HRA, special allowance, reimbursements, variable)</li>
      <li>Joining date, probation period, notice period</li>
      <li>Non-compete and non-solicitation clauses (limited scope)</li>
      <li>IP assignment clause — inventions and work product created during employment belong to the company</li>
      <li>Confidentiality obligations during and after employment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well-drafted employment agreements prevent disputes over termination, intellectual property, and post-employment competition.</p>

    <h2 id="vendor">5. Vendor, Client, and Service Agreements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Agreement / MSA:</strong> Governs ongoing service relationships — scope of work, payment terms, SLAs, IP ownership, limitation of liability, indemnity</li>
      <li><strong>Purchase Order (PO):</strong> For one-time vendor transactions — price, delivery, quality standards, payment</li>
      <li><strong>Franchise Agreement:</strong> If licensing your brand/business model — territory, fees, training, quality control</li>
      <li><strong>Distributor/Dealer Agreement:</strong> For product distribution — territory, pricing, targets, termination</li>
      <li><strong>Loan Agreement:</strong> For inter-company or personal loans — amount, interest rate, repayment schedule, security, events of default</li>
    </ul>
