    <div class="content">
        <p>A Partnership Firm is one of India's oldest and most widely used business structures — enabling two or more individuals to come together, pool resources, and run a business together under a formal agreement. While simpler than a company, a partnership firm still requires proper legal documentation and registration to enjoy the full benefits of legal recognition. This guide covers partnership firm registration, the Partnership Deed, advantages, limitations, and compliance requirements.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Starting a business with a partner?</strong> Our CA team drafts comprehensive Partnership Deeds and handles Registrar of Firms registration for partnership firms across India — protecting all partners' rights from day one. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20want%20to%20register%20a%20Partnership%20Firm" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Chat with us on WhatsApp</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="what-is">1. What is a Partnership Firm?</h2>
        <p>A Partnership is defined under the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 as the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all. It requires a minimum of 2 partners and can have a maximum of 50 partners (reduced from 20 after Companies Act 2013 notification).</p>
        <p>A partnership firm does NOT have a separate legal identity from its partners — unlike an LLP or company. This means partners are personally liable for the firm's debts and obligations — and creditors can recover from partners' personal assets. This unlimited liability is the key risk of a traditional partnership firm.</p>

        <h2 id="deed">2. Partnership Deed — The Foundation of Every Partnership</h2>
        <p>The Partnership Deed is the most critical document for any partnership firm — it governs the rights, duties, and obligations of all partners. A poorly drafted Partnership Deed is one of the most common causes of partnership disputes. A comprehensive deed covers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Name and address</strong> of the firm and all partners</li>
            <li><strong>Nature of business</strong> — what the firm will do</li>
            <li><strong>Capital contribution</strong> by each partner</li>
            <li><strong>Profit and loss sharing ratio</strong> — how profits and losses are divided</li>
            <li><strong>Partner Remuneration:</strong> Salary/commission to working partners (subject to Section 40(b) of Income Tax Act)</li>
            <li><strong>Interest on Capital and Drawings</strong> — rates and treatment</li>
            <li><strong>Management and decision-making:</strong> Who manages day-to-day operations, how major decisions are made</li>
            <li><strong>Admission and exit of partners</strong> — procedures and valuation</li>
            <li><strong>Death or retirement of a partner</strong> — how the firm continues and how the outgoing partner is settled</li>
            <li><strong>Dissolution provisions</strong> — when and how the firm can be dissolved</li>
            <li><strong>Dispute resolution</strong> — arbitration clauses</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box"><p>&#9888;&#65039; <strong>Never run a partnership without a registered, well-drafted Partnership Deed.</strong> Verbal or undocumented arrangements lead to catastrophic disputes when partners disagree — as commonly seen in family and friend partnerships. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20a%20comprehensive%20Partnership%20Deed%20drafted" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Get your Partnership Deed drafted by our CA</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="registration">3. Registration of Partnership Firm</h2>
        <p>Registration of a partnership firm with the Registrar of Firms is not compulsory under the Indian Partnership Act — but it is strongly advisable. An unregistered partnership firm cannot:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sue a third party in the firm's name in a court of law</li>
            <li>Enforce rights under the partnership deed against other partners in court</li>
            <li>Claim set-off against claims exceeding ₹100</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Process for Registration:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare and execute the Partnership Deed on stamp paper of appropriate value (varies by state)</li>
            <li>File Application for Registration (Form 1) with the Registrar of Firms of the relevant state</li>
            <li>Submit notarised copy of Partnership Deed, affidavit, and prescribed fee</li>
            <li>On approval, the Registrar issues a Certificate of Registration</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="taxation">4. Taxation of Partnership Firm</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Partnership firm is taxed at a flat rate of <strong>30%</strong> on its total income (plus applicable surcharge and cess).</li>
            <li><strong>Partners' share of profit</strong> from the firm is completely exempt from income tax in their hands — no double taxation.</li>
            <li><strong>Remuneration to partners</strong> (salary, commission) is deductible in the firm's hands subject to limits under Section 40(b) — and taxable in the partner's individual hands.</li>
            <li><strong>Interest paid to partners on capital</strong> is deductible up to 12% per annum — and taxable in the partner's hands.</li>
            <li>Tax audit is mandatory if turnover exceeds ₹1 crore (₹10 crore for 95% digital transactions).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="llp-vs-partnership">5. When to Convert from Partnership to LLP</h2>
        <p>A traditional partnership firm may need to convert to an LLP when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Partners want limited liability protection — partners in a regular firm have unlimited personal liability</li>
            <li>The firm wants a more structured governance framework</li>
            <li>The firm seeks bank loans where lenders prefer LLP structure</li>
            <li>Business scale makes personal liability risk unacceptably high</li>
        </ul>
