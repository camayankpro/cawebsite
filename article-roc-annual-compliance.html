        <p>ROC Annual Compliance is a set of mandatory filings that every Private Limited Company, One Person Company, LLP, and other registered entity must complete with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) every year — regardless of turnover, profit, or business activity. Missing these filings attracts heavy penalties, director disqualification, and company strike-off. This guide covers the complete annual ROC compliance calendar for companies and LLPs.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Don't miss your ROC filings.</strong> Our CA team handles complete annual ROC compliance — financial statements, annual returns, DIR-3 KYC, and AGM — for companies and LLPs across India. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20ROC%20Annual%20Compliance%20services%20for%20my%20company" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>
