        <p>Bank Audit is a specialised area of auditing — covering the examination of the books, accounts, financial statements, and operations of banks and financial institutions. In India, bank audits are conducted at multiple levels — from individual branch audits to concurrent audits to central statutory audits — and are governed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines, the Banking Regulation Act, and the Companies Act. For CA firms empanelled for bank audit, it is one of the most demanding and high-impact audit assignments. This guide explains bank audit in detail.</p>

        <h2 id="what-is">1. What is Bank Audit?</h2>
        <p>Bank Audit refers to the examination and verification of the accounts, transactions, financial statements, and compliance of a bank or financial institution by an independent Chartered Accountant. Unlike a corporate audit (which covers a company's financials), bank audit covers highly specialised areas — loan portfolios, non-performing assets (NPAs), provisioning norms, RBI compliance, KYC norms, forex transactions, and treasury operations.</p>
        <p>Given the systemic importance of banks to the economy, bank audits are stringently regulated. The RBI prescribes the scope of audit, qualification requirements for auditors, and specific reporting requirements that go far beyond what is required in a typical corporate audit.</p>

        <h2 id="types">2. Types of Bank Audits in India</h2>

        <h3>Statutory Central Audit:</h3>
        <p>Conducted at the Head Office level of a bank — the central statutory audit covers the consolidated financial statements of the bank. Only large CA firms are eligible for central statutory audit empanelment. The Central Statutory Auditor issues the overall audit report that accompanies the bank's annual financial statements.</p>

        <h3>Statutory Branch Audit:</h3>
        <p>Individual branches of banks (above a certain business size) are subject to statutory branch audits by separately appointed CA firms. The branch auditor verifies the branch's advances, deposits, profit and loss, and compliance — and submits a Long Form Audit Report (LFAR) along with the main audit report. Branch auditors report to the Central Statutory Auditor.</p>

        <h3>Concurrent Audit:</h3>
        <p>A near-real-time audit of a bank branch's transactions — covering daily/weekly verification of large transactions, loan disbursements, forex transactions, compliance with RBI guidelines, and adherence to bank's internal policies. Concurrent auditors are typically stationed at the branch or review transaction data regularly throughout the year — catching errors and compliance violations before they become entrenched.</p>

        <h3>Revenue Audit (Income &amp; Expenditure Audit):</h3>
        <p>Focuses on verifying the correctness of income recognition — interest income, processing fees, penalties, commission — and ensuring that no income is missed or understated (which would affect profit and capital adequacy).</p>

        <h3>Stock Audit of Bank Borrowers:</h3>
        <p>Banks that have extended working capital loans (Cash Credit / OD limits) against the security of stock (inventory) and debtors are required to periodically get the stock and debtors verified by an independent CA firm. This is a Stock Audit — discussed in a separate article — but it falls within the umbrella of bank-related audits.</p>

        <h2 id="lfar">3. Long Form Audit Report (LFAR) — The Core of Branch Audit</h2>
        <p>The Long Form Audit Report is a detailed questionnaire-style report submitted by the branch statutory auditor covering over 100 specific aspects of the branch's operations, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advances portfolio — classification of all loans by category, NPA status, adequacy of provisioning</li>
            <li>Fraud reporting — any suspected or confirmed frauds during the year</li>
            <li>KYC/AML compliance — adherence to Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering guidelines</li>
            <li>Income recognition — whether interest income is correctly recognised on non-performing accounts</li>
            <li>Deposit operations — unauthorized accounts, dormant account management</li>
            <li>Cash management — surprise cash verification results</li>
            <li>Compliance with RBI circulars and instructions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="npa">4. NPA Classification and Provisioning — Key Focus Area</h2>
        <p>The most critical area of bank branch audit is the verification of the asset quality — specifically whether loans are correctly classified as Standard, Sub-Standard, Doubtful, or Loss Assets, and whether the required provisioning has been made as per RBI's Prudential Norms. Incorrect NPA classification (showing a bad loan as standard) is one of the most serious audit issues in banking, with significant implications for the bank's capital adequacy and published profitability.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <p>&#128204; <strong>RBI's IRACP norms</strong> (Income Recognition, Asset Classification, and Provisioning) govern how banks must classify loans and make provisions. Branch auditors must verify compliance with these norms for every significant advance account. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20CA%20firm%20for%20bank%20branch%20audit%20empanelment" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Discuss bank audit services</a></p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="stock-audit-borrower">5. Stock Audit for Bank Borrowers</h2>
        <p>If your business has a working capital loan (Cash Credit or OD facility) from a bank secured by inventory and debtors, the bank will periodically require a <strong>Stock Audit</strong> — conducted by an independent CA appointed by the bank. The stock auditor physically verifies your inventory, checks your debtors list, and reports on whether the drawing power (amount you can draw from the CC limit) is justified by actual stock and debtors on hand.</p>
        <p>Businesses with CC limits should ensure their stock records are always accurate and their debtors list is reconciled — a poor stock audit report can lead to reduction of your CC limit or even recall of the facility.</p>
