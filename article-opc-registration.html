    <div class="content">
        <p>The One Person Company (OPC) is a unique and powerful business structure introduced by the Companies Act, 2013 — enabling a single individual to form a company and enjoy the benefits of limited liability and corporate structure without needing a co-founder or partner. It is ideal for solo entrepreneurs, consultants, freelancers, and small business owners who want the credibility and protection of a company structure. This guide covers OPC registration, advantages, limitations, and compliance.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Solo entrepreneur wanting company status?</strong> Our CA team provides complete OPC registration services for individual entrepreneurs across India. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20want%20to%20register%20a%20One%20Person%20Company%20OPC" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Register your OPC on WhatsApp</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="what-is">1. What is a One Person Company (OPC)?</h2>
        <p>A One Person Company (OPC) is a company that has only one member (shareholder). It is registered under the Companies Act, 2013 — and like a Private Limited Company, it has a separate legal identity, limited liability, and perpetual succession. The single member must be a natural person — an Indian citizen and resident (present in India for at least 182 days in the preceding calendar year). A unique requirement is the nomination of a <strong>Nominee Member</strong> — an individual who will take over the OPC in case the sole member dies or becomes incapacitated.</p>

        <h2 id="advantages">2. Advantages of OPC</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solo Ownership with Corporate Status:</strong> No need for a co-founder — one person can own and control 100% of the company.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Liability:</strong> Personal assets of the sole member are protected from company liabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Separate Legal Entity:</strong> OPC can own assets, sign contracts, and sue/be sued in its own name.</li>
            <li><strong>Credibility:</strong> "Pvt Ltd (OPC)" suffix gives the business formal corporate recognition.</li>
            <li><strong>Single Director:</strong> Only one director is required — the same person can be both director and shareholder.</li>
            <li><strong>Fewer Compliance Obligations:</strong> OPCs are exempt from holding AGMs and have relaxed board meeting requirements (minimum 1 meeting per half-year, or just resolutions passed in writing).</li>
            <li><strong>Bank Loan Access:</strong> Banks are more comfortable lending to registered companies than unregistered proprietorships.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="limitations">3. Limitations of OPC</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Not for Large Businesses:</strong> OPC must convert to Pvt Ltd or Public Company when paid-up capital exceeds ₹50 lakh or turnover exceeds ₹2 crore in three consecutive years.</li>
            <li><strong>No ESOP:</strong> Cannot issue Employee Stock Options — limiting talent attraction for high-growth businesses.</li>
            <li><strong>Not Suitable for Investor Funding:</strong> Investors typically require Pvt Ltd structure for equity investment.</li>
            <li><strong>Only Indian Resident Individuals:</strong> Foreign nationals cannot form an OPC.</li>
            <li><strong>One OPC Per Person:</strong> A person can be a member or nominee in only one OPC at a time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="process">4. OPC Registration Process</h2>
        <div class="box"><p>&#128221; <strong>End-to-end handled by our CA team.</strong> Our team manages the complete filing, submission, and follow-up process on your behalf — so you can focus on your business. Get in touch with us for a free initial consultation.</p></div>

        <h2 id="conversion">5. OPC to Private Limited Company Conversion</h2>
        <p>When an OPC grows beyond the prescribed thresholds (paid-up capital &gt; ₹50 lakh or turnover &gt; ₹2 crore for 3 consecutive years), it must mandatorily convert to a Private Limited Company. Voluntary conversion is also permitted after 2 years from incorporation. Our CA team manages the conversion process seamlessly — filing the required forms, amending MOA/AOA, and obtaining the revised Certificate of Incorporation.</p>

        <h2 id="compliance">6. Annual Compliance for OPC</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Statutory Audit:</strong> Mandatory every financial year.</li>
            <li><strong>ROC Filing:</strong> AOC-4 (financial statements) — within 180 days of financial year end (extended deadline for OPCs).</li>
            <li><strong>Income Tax Return:</strong> ITR-6 filed annually.</li>
            <li><strong>Director KYC:</strong> DIR-3 KYC by September 30 every year.</li>
            <li><strong>Board Meetings:</strong> Minimum 1 meeting per half of the calendar year (or resolution by circulation).</li>
        </ul>
