        <p>Winding up and striking off a company or LLP is the formal legal process of closing the entity — distributing assets, settling liabilities, and removing the entity from the MCA register. Many business owners are unaware that an inactive company still accumulates annual compliance obligations, penalties, and director liability — the longer you wait, the more expensive and complicated it becomes. This guide explains the winding up and strike-off options available in India.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Have a dormant or inactive company you want to close?</strong> Our CA team helps businesses wind up and strike off Pvt Ltd companies, OPCs, and LLPs cleanly — settling compliance and closing the entity correctly. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20want%20to%20wind%20up%20or%20close%20my%20company%20or%20LLP" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="stk2">2. Fast Track Strike Off — STK-2 (Most Common)</h2>
        <p>The Fast Track Strike Off is the simplest and most cost-effective way to close a dormant or inactive Private Limited Company, OPC, or company that has never commenced business. Eligibility conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Company has not commenced business within 1 year of incorporation, OR</li>
            <li>Company has not been carrying on any business or operation for the immediately preceding 2 financial years and has not made any application to be declared as dormant</li>
            <li>No pending liabilities — all dues to government (tax, GST, TDS) settled</li>
            <li>Bank account closed</li>
            <li>All pending annual filings cleared (though MCA has amended this — file everything first)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="mini-cta"><p>Before filing STK-2, all pending ITRs, ROC annual filings, and GST returns must be up to date. Our team clears the compliance backlog before filing the strike-off application.</p><a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20want%20to%20clear%20pending%20compliance%20and%20then%20close%20my%20company">Clear Compliance &amp; Close Company &#8594;</a></div>

        <h3>STK-2 Process:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Board resolution and special resolution (if required) approving closure</li>
            <li>File all pending ITRs, ROC returns, and GST returns</li>
            <li>Close all bank accounts — obtain bank closure certificate</li>
            <li>File Form STK-2 with affidavit, indemnity bond, statement of accounts (not older than 30 days), and NOC from tax authorities</li>
            <li>MCA publishes notice in Official Gazette — 30-day objection window</li>
            <li>If no objections — company struck off. Strike-off order published in Official Gazette.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="llp-closure">3. LLP Closure — Form 24</h2>
        <p>An LLP with nil assets and nil liabilities can apply for strike-off in Form 24 — with consent of all partners, a declaration that there are no pending liabilities, and all LLP returns filed up to date. The process is similar to STK-2 and typically completed within 90 days.</p>

        <h2 id="consequences">4. Consequences of Not Closing an Inactive Company</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accumulating ROC penalties:</strong> ₹100/day for missed filings — compounding year after year with no upper limit</li>
            <li><strong>Director disqualification:</strong> Directors of companies with 3+ years of missed annual returns face 5-year disqualification under Section 164(2)</li>
            <li><strong>Income tax notices:</strong> ITD may issue notices and levy penalties for non-filing of ITRs</li>
            <li><strong>GST notices:</strong> If GST was registered — non-filing leads to GSTIN suspension and penalties</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box warn"><p>&#9888;&#65039; <strong>An inactive company is never truly dormant from a compliance standpoint.</strong> Every day of inaction adds to the penalty burden and director liability. Close it properly — or apply for dormant company status — to draw a clean line.</p></div>
