        <p>The Import Export Code (IEC) is a mandatory 10-digit code issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) — required for any business or individual engaged in importing or exporting goods or services from India. Without IEC, your goods cannot be cleared by customs and your bank cannot process international remittances for trade. This guide explains IEC — who needs it, how to apply, and how to keep it updated.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Starting import or export from India?</strong> Our CA team obtains IEC for businesses across India — proprietary firms, companies, LLPs, and individuals. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20Import%20Export%20Code%20IEC%20registration" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="who-needs">1. Who Needs an IEC?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Any person / company importing goods into India or exporting goods out of India</li>
            <li>Service exporters receiving foreign remittances (for FEMA compliance and bank processing)</li>
            <li>E-commerce sellers exporting through platforms like eBay, Amazon Global, or directly shipping internationally</li>
            <li>Businesses receiving advance payment for export or making advance payment for import</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Exemptions (IEC not required):</strong> Imports/exports for personal use (not commercial); government departments and notified charitable organisations.</p>

        <h2 id="documents">2. Documents Required for IEC Application</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>PAN of applicant (individual / firm / company)</li>
            <li>Aadhaar / Passport / Voter ID of proprietor / partners / directors (for identity proof)</li>
            <li>Address proof of business (bank statement, utility bill, rent agreement)</li>
            <li>Bank account details: cancelled cheque or bank certificate with IFSC and account number</li>
            <li>For companies / LLPs: Certificate of Incorporation, MOA/LLP Agreement</li>
            <li>Digital Signature Certificate (Class 3) or Aadhaar OTP for online authentication</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="annual-update">4. IEC Annual Update — Mandatory</h2>
        <p>From April 2021, IEC holders must update their IEC profile annually on the DGFT portal between April and June each year — even if there are no changes. This is a simple online confirmation/update process. Failure to update results in deactivation of the IEC — making it unusable for customs clearances. Our CA team sets up annual IEC update reminders and completes the update for all clients.</p>

        <div class="mini-cta"><p>IEC holders must update their profile annually — April to June. Many businesses miss this and get their IEC deactivated mid-shipment. Our team tracks this for you.</p><a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20help%20with%20IEC%20annual%20update">IEC Annual Update Help &#8594;</a></div>

        <h2 id="modification">5. IEC Modification</h2>
        <p>IEC must be updated when any of the following change: business address, bank account details, addition of new branch/premises, change in constitution (e.g., proprietorship to company). Modification is done online on the DGFT portal within the same process as the annual update. Outdated IEC details can cause delays in customs clearances and bank processing.</p>
