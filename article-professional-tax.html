    <div class="content">
        <p>Professional Tax is a state-level tax levied on individuals earning income through employment, profession, trade, or business — collected by state governments and used for local administrative purposes. It is one of the few taxes deductible by employers from employee salaries (like TDS), and non-compliance attracts penalties and interest. This guide explains Professional Tax applicability, state-wise rates, registration, and compliance obligations for businesses and employers across India.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Setting up payroll in a new state?</strong> Professional Tax registration and monthly deduction compliance is mandatory for employers in most Indian states. Our CA team handles PT registration and compliance across India. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20Professional%20Tax%20registration%20and%20compliance%20help" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="applicability">1. Where Does Professional Tax Apply?</h2>
        <p>Professional Tax is levied by state governments — not all states have it. States where PT currently applies include: Maharashtra, Karnataka, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Meghalaya, Orissa, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Sikkim. States like Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, and Himachal Pradesh do <strong>not</strong> levy Professional Tax.</p>

        <div class="mini-cta"><p>Operating in multiple states? Each state has its own PT rates, slabs, and compliance requirements. Our CA team manages multi-state PT compliance for businesses.</p><a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20professional%20tax%20compliance%20across%20multiple%20states">Multi-State PT Compliance &#8594;</a></div>

        <h2 id="rates">2. Professional Tax Rates — Key States</h2>
        <table class="table">
            <tr><th>State</th><th>Maximum Annual PT (per employee)</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Maharashtra</td><td>₹2,500</td><td>₹200/month for 11 months + ₹300 in February</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Karnataka</td><td>₹2,400</td><td>₹200/month</td></tr>
            <tr><td>West Bengal</td><td>₹2,500</td><td>Slab-based on gross salary</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Tamil Nadu</td><td>₹1,200</td><td>₹100/month above ₹21,000 salary</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Gujarat</td><td>₹2,500</td><td>Slab-based</td></tr>

        </table>
        <p><strong>Exemptions from PT</strong> vary by state but commonly include: women earning below a threshold, disabled persons, parents of disabled children, armed forces personnel, and senior citizens.</p>

        <h2 id="employer-obligations">3. Employer Obligations under Professional Tax</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Employer Registration:</strong> Every employer must register with the state PT authority — separate from employee registration. Penalties for late registration.</li>
            <li><strong>Employee Registration:</strong> Each employee earning above the exempt threshold must be registered. PT is deducted from their salary each month.</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly Deduction:</strong> Deduct PT from eligible employees' salaries each month as per state slab rates</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly Remittance:</strong> Pay the deducted PT to the state government by the due date (usually 20th of the following month)</li>
            <li><strong>Annual Return / Enrollment:</strong> File annual PT return as per state requirement</li>
            <li><strong>PT on self-employed / proprietors:</strong> Proprietors and self-employed individuals must register and pay PT on their own income from profession/trade</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="it-deduction">4. Income Tax Deduction for PT Paid</h2>
        <p>Professional Tax paid by an employee is fully deductible under Section 16(iii) of the Income Tax Act — reducing the taxable income in the employee's hands. Employers deduct PT from salary, deposit it with the state, and reflect it in Form 16. This is one of the standard deductions from gross salary before computing income tax.</p>
