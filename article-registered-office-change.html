        <p>Changing the registered office of a company or LLP is a routine but procedure-heavy corporate action. Whether you're relocating within the same city, to a different city in the same state, or to a different state entirely — each type of change has different procedural requirements, approval levels, and timelines. This guide explains the complete registered office change process under the Companies Act, 2013.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Relocating your company's registered office?</strong> Our CA team handles the complete process — board resolutions, MCA filings, and ROC intimation — for registered office changes across India. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20want%20to%20change%20my%20company%20registered%20office" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="types">1. Types of Registered Office Change</h2>
        <table class="table">
            <tr><th>Type of Change</th><th>Approval Required</th><th>MCA Form</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Within same city / town / village</td><td>Board Resolution only</td><td>INC-22 (within 30 days)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Outside current city but within same RoC jurisdiction and same state</td><td>Special Resolution (shareholders)</td><td>MGT-14 + INC-22</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Within same state but different RoC jurisdiction</td><td>Special Resolution + Regional Director (RD) approval</td><td>MGT-14 + INC-23 + INC-22</td></tr>
            <tr><td>From one state to another state</td><td>Special Resolution + Central Government (RD) approval + Creditor/employee NOC</td><td>MGT-14 + INC-23 + INC-22 + Publication in newspaper</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h2 id="within-city">2. Change Within Same City — Simplest Type</h2>
        <p>For a change within the same city/town/village — the easiest type:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pass board resolution approving new address and authorising director to file INC-22</li>
            <li>File Form INC-22 on MCA portal within 30 days of board resolution</li>
            <li>Attach: utility bill or rent agreement + NOC from property owner for new premises</li>
            <li>Update GST registration (same GSTIN for same state), bank accounts, and all correspondence</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="mini-cta"><p>GST must be updated separately after every registered office change — our team handles GST amendment filing alongside MCA forms.</p><a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20help%20with%20registered%20office%20change%20and%20GST%20amendment">Handle GST Amendment Too &#8594;</a></div>

        <h2 id="inter-state">3. Inter-State Registered Office Change — Most Complex</h2>
        <p>Moving the registered office from one state to another is the most procedure-intensive change. Key requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Special Resolution:</strong> Passed at EGM (75% shareholder majority) — must be passed at least one month before filing with Regional Director</li>
            <li><strong>Advertisement in newspapers:</strong> One in English and one in vernacular language (of the state where the registered office is currently situated) — at least one month before filing with RD</li>
            <li><strong>Notice to creditors and debenture holders:</strong> Individual notice along with newspaper advertisement</li>
            <li><strong>No objection from creditors:</strong> If any creditor objects, the court / Tribunal may direct security to be deposited</li>
            <li><strong>Regional Director (RD) Application — INC-23:</strong> Filed with the MCA's Regional Director of the current state</li>
            <li><strong>RD Order:</strong> Issued within 30 days if no objection; up to 60 days if objections received</li>
            <li><strong>INC-22:</strong> Filed with the new state's RoC within 60 days of RD order — along with fresh COI</li>
            <li><strong>Amendment of MOA:</strong> Change in registered office address in MOA requires alteration — included in the special resolution</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="gst-impact">4. GST and Other Regulatory Impact</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Same state change:</strong> GSTIN remains. Update address in GST registration within 15 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Inter-state change:</strong> New GST registration in the new state required. Old registration to be surrendered. Transitional ITC may be affected — plan carefully.</li>
            <li><strong>Bank accounts:</strong> Update bank with new address and new state branch if required</li>
            <li><strong>Labour law registrations:</strong> PF, ESI, professional tax — re-register in the new state</li>
            <li><strong>Contracts and licenses:</strong> May need to be updated — especially state-specific licenses (Shop Act, factory license, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
