        <h2 id="who-needs">1. Who Must Register for GST in Delhi?</h2>
        <p>As per the GST Act, 2017, the following businesses in Delhi must mandatorily register for GST:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Turnover threshold:</strong> Annual turnover above ₹40 lakh for goods suppliers; above ₹20 lakh for service providers in Delhi</li>
            <li><strong>Interstate suppliers:</strong> Delhi businesses supplying to UP, Haryana, Rajasthan, or any other state — regardless of turnover</li>
            <li><strong>E-commerce sellers:</strong> All sellers on Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, Myntra, Nykaa — mandatory regardless of annual turnover</li>
            <li><strong>Importers &amp; exporters:</strong> Using ICD Tughlakabad, IGI Airport cargo, or any Delhi port of entry/exit</li>
            <li><strong>Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM):</strong> Businesses receiving specified supplies on which they must pay GST under RCM</li>
            <li><strong>Professionals (lawyers, CAs, architects, consultants):</strong> Above ₹20 lakh threshold — must register</li>
            <li><strong>Restaurants, hotels, catering services:</strong> Above threshold; applicable GST rates depend on whether ITC is claimed</li>
            <li><strong>Real estate developers:</strong> On taxable under-construction residential and commercial projects</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even below the threshold, <strong>voluntary GST registration</strong> is strongly advised for Delhi's B2B-heavy trading and services community — most large buyers and export houses in Delhi require a GSTIN from their suppliers.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2 id="penalty">7. Penalty for Non-Registration</h2>
        <p>Operating without GST registration when mandatory attracts a penalty of <strong>10% of tax due (minimum ₹10,000)</strong>. For deliberate tax evasion: <strong>100% of the tax amount</strong>. In Delhi's highly networked trading and corporate ecosystem, operating without a GSTIN routinely blocks businesses from the city's largest buyers, export opportunities, and government tender eligibility.</p>

        <div class="box warn"><p>&#9888;&#65039; <strong>Critical for Delhi businesses:</strong> GST registration is required <em>before</em> making the first taxable supply — not after crossing the turnover threshold. Retrospective registration demands include penalties and interest on all past taxable supplies. Register before you transact — it is free and opens significant business opportunities.</p></div>
