    <div class="content">
        <p>E-Invoicing under GST is not optional for eligible businesses — it is a mandatory compliance that determines whether your invoices are valid, whether your buyers get ITC, and whether your e-way bills are automatically generated. Since its phased rollout beginning with large taxpayers, e-invoicing now applies to businesses with turnover above ₹5 crore — and the threshold keeps reducing. This guide explains e-invoicing comprehensively — applicability, process, IRP, exceptions, and penalties.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Need e-invoicing setup for your business?</strong> Our CA team helps businesses configure e-invoicing on their accounting software — correctly and completely. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20help%20with%20GST%20e-invoicing%20setup%20for%20my%20business" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="what-is">1. What is E-Invoicing?</h2>
        <p>E-Invoicing (Electronic Invoicing) is the system under which B2B invoices, debit notes, and credit notes must be reported to the Government's Invoice Registration Portal (IRP) in real time before the invoice is issued to the buyer. The IRP validates the invoice, assigns a unique Invoice Reference Number (IRN), generates a QR code, and returns the signed invoice JSON. The invoice is valid only after IRP registration — an unregistered invoice is invalid for ITC and illegal for B2B transactions.</p>

        <h2 id="applicability">2. Who Must Use E-Invoicing?</h2>
        <table class="table">
            <tr><th>Turnover (any preceding FY from 2017-18)</th><th>Applicable From</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Above ₹500 crore</td><td>1 October 2020</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Above ₹100 crore</td><td>1 January 2021</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Above ₹50 crore</td><td>1 April 2021</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Above ₹20 crore</td><td>1 April 2022</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Above ₹10 crore</td><td>1 October 2022</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Above ₹5 crore</strong></td><td><strong>1 August 2023</strong></td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>If your turnover in <em>any</em> previous year from FY 2017-18 exceeded the applicable threshold — e-invoicing is mandatory for you in the current year.</p>

        <h2 id="exceptions">3. Who is Exempt from E-Invoicing?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Insurance companies, banks, NBFCs, and financial institutions</li>
            <li>Goods Transport Agencies (GTA)</li>
            <li>Passenger transport companies</li>
            <li>Multiplex cinema operators (for admission tickets)</li>
            <li>Special Economic Zone (SEZ) units (not developers)</li>
            <li>Government departments and local authorities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="penalty">5. Consequences of Non-Compliance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Invoice without IRN is invalid:</strong> Buyer cannot claim ITC on it — making your supplies commercially unacceptable for B2B buyers</li>
            <li><strong>Penalty:</strong> ₹10,000 per invoice for failure to generate e-invoice when required</li>
            <li><strong>GST audit trigger:</strong> Mismatch between e-invoice data and GSTR-1 will be flagged automatically</li>
            <li><strong>E-way bill cannot be generated</strong> independently for e-invoice eligible taxpayers — must go through IRP</li>
        </ul>
