    <p>A Director Identification Number (DIN) is a unique 8-digit identification number issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) to every individual who is or intends to become a director of a company in India. Without a DIN, you cannot be appointed as a director in any company in India. This guide explains everything you need to know about obtaining and maintaining a DIN.</p>

    <h2 id="what-is">1. What is DIN and Why is it Required?</h2>
    <p>DIN (Director Identification Number) is a unique identifier issued under Section 154 of the Companies Act, 2013 to every individual who wishes to be a director in an Indian company. Key facts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every director must have a valid DIN before being appointed to any company</li>
      <li>A person can hold only one DIN — you cannot apply for a second DIN</li>
      <li>DIN is for life — once obtained, you don&#39;t need to apply again (but need annual KYC)</li>
      <li>DIN is linked to your PAN and Aadhaar — these must match your MCA records</li>
      <li>DIN is required regardless of the number of companies you are a director in — one DIN covers all directorships</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Who needs a DIN:</strong> Proposed directors of Private Limited Companies, OPCs, Public Companies, Section 8 companies; designated partners of LLPs also need a DPIN (Designated Partner Identification Number) — practically the same process as DIN.</p>

    <h2 id="apply">2. How to Apply for DIN</h2>
    <p>There are two ways to obtain a DIN:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Route 1 — Through SPICe+ (At incorporation):</strong> If you are incorporating a new company, DIN is automatically allotted to proposed directors during the SPICe+ incorporation process. Up to 3 proposed directors can get DIN via SPICe+ simultaneously — no separate DIR-3 needed. This is the fastest route for new companies.</li>
      <li><strong>Route 2 — Standalone DIR-3 Application:</strong> If you need a DIN independently (for an existing company or for a foreign national), file Form DIR-3 on MCA portal (the official government portal).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Documents Required for DIR-3:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Self-attested photo (passport size)</li>
      <li>Identity proof: PAN card (mandatory for Indian nationals) + Aadhaar card</li>
      <li>Address proof: Aadhaar, voter ID, driving licence, or passport</li>
      <li>For foreign nationals: Passport (apostilled or notarised) + address proof in country of residence</li>
      <li>The application must be digitally signed by the applicant (if they have DSC) OR certified by a practising CA/CS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>DIN is typically allotted within 1–2 working days of successful DIR-3 submission.</p>

    <div class="mini-cta"><p>DIN allotment via SPICe+ during company incorporation is instant and free as part of the incorporation process. If you&#39;re starting a new company, there&#39;s no need to separately apply for DIN beforehand.</p><a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20help%20with%20DIN%20application%20or%20company%20incorporation">Company Incorporation + DIN Help &#8594;</a></div>

    <h2 id="kyc">3. Annual DIN KYC — DIR-3 KYC</h2>
    <p>Every DIN holder must complete annual KYC (Know Your Customer) by filing Form DIR-3 KYC on MCA portal — on or before 30th September of each year. This is mandatory regardless of whether you are currently a director or not. Key points:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Who must file:</strong> Every DIN holder — including individuals who are no longer active directors but have a live DIN</li>
      <li><strong>What to update:</strong> Mobile number (OTP verified), email address (OTP verified), and other personal details</li>
      <li><strong>Deadline:</strong> 30 September each year — for the previous financial year</li>
      <li><strong>Late filing fee:</strong> ₹5,000 for filing after 30 September (before DIN gets deactivated)</li>
      <li><strong>Web-based KYC:</strong> For directors with no changes to existing KYC details — simpler web form (DIR-3 KYC Web) without DSC required</li>
      <li><strong>Form-based KYC:</strong> For directors updating details or filing for the first time — Form DIR-3 KYC with DSC</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="deactivation">4. DIN Deactivation and Reactivation</h2>
    <p>If DIR-3 KYC is not filed by 30 September, the MCA automatically deactivates the DIN. Consequences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The person cannot sign any MCA forms or filings — the company&#39;s ROC filings cannot proceed if a director&#39;s DIN is deactivated</li>
      <li>The person cannot be appointed as a director in any company</li>
      <li>Any existing directorship technically continues — but company filings requiring that director&#39;s DSC are blocked</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Reactivation:</strong> File DIR-3 KYC with a late fee of ₹5,000 — DIN is reactivated immediately upon successful filing and payment. MCA portal accepts late DIR-3 KYC throughout the year.</p>

    <h2 id="faq">5. Common DIN FAQs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Can I have two DINs?</strong> No — having two DINs is an offence under the Companies Act. If you inadvertently have two DINs, you must surrender the duplicate via Form DIR-5.</li>
      <li><strong>Do LLP partners need DIN?</strong> Designated partners of LLPs need a DPIN — which is obtained exactly like a DIN via DIR-3. Regular partners do not need DPIN.</li>
      <li><strong>Can an NRI be a director?</strong> Yes — NRIs and foreign nationals can be directors. They apply for DIN via DIR-3 with apostilled/notarised foreign identity documents.</li>
      <li><strong>What if my Aadhaar name and PAN name don&#39;t match?</strong> Name mismatch between Aadhaar and PAN is the most common cause of DIR-3 rejection — resolve the mismatch first via UIDAI or income tax portal before applying.</li>
      <li><strong>Can DIN be cancelled voluntarily?</strong> Yes — a person who has never been a director and doesn&#39;t intend to become one can surrender DIN via Form DIR-5.</li>
    </ul>
