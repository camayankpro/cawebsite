        <p>Payroll Management is far more than just transferring salaries to employees' bank accounts. It encompasses salary structure design, statutory deductions (TDS, PF, ESI, Professional Tax), payslip generation, compliance filings, and annual Form 16 issuance — all of which must be completed accurately and on time every month. For growing businesses, payroll complexity increases rapidly with headcount. This guide explains the full scope of payroll management and how to do it right.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Need professional payroll management for your business?</strong> Our CA team provides end-to-end monthly payroll processing for businesses across India — salary computation, TDS, PF, ESI, payslips, and Form 16. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20Payroll%20Management%20services%20for%20my%20business" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="components">1. Salary Structure — Key Components</h2>
        <p>A well-designed salary structure balances employee take-home pay with tax efficiency and statutory compliance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic Salary:</strong> Typically 40–50% of CTC — forms the base for PF calculation, gratuity, and leave encashment</li>
            <li><strong>HRA (House Rent Allowance):</strong> Usually 40–50% of basic — partially exempt from income tax for employees paying rent</li>
            <li><strong>Special Allowance:</strong> Remaining CTC component — fully taxable</li>
            <li><strong>LTA (Leave Travel Allowance):</strong> Exempt for actual travel costs twice in a 4-year block</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Reimbursement / Meal Vouchers:</strong> Tax-efficient perquisite components</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Bonus / Variable Pay:</strong> Taxable in the month of payment</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="monthly-cycle">3. Monthly Payroll Processing Cycle</h2>
        <ul>
