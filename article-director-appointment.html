    <p>Adding a new director to your company — whether it's a co-founder joining mid-way, a professional director for governance, an investor nominee, or a family member — is one of the most common corporate changes a company makes. The Companies Act, 2013 has a defined procedure for this, and ROC filing (DIR-12) is mandatory within 30 days. This guide walks you through the complete process for Indian Private Limited Companies and OPCs.</p>

    <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Need to appoint a new director in your company?</strong> Our CA team handles DIN application, DIR-2 consent, board resolutions, and DIR-12 ROC filing — for companies in Hapur, NCR, UP, and across India. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20to%20appoint%20a%20new%20director%20in%20my%20company" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

    <h2 id="eligibility">1. Who Can Be Appointed as Director?</h2>
    <p>Any individual (not a body corporate) can be appointed as a director, subject to these conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Must have a valid DIN (Director Identification Number) issued by MCA</li>
      <li>Must not be of unsound mind or declared insolvent</li>
      <li>Must not have been convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months or more — and 5 years have not elapsed since release</li>
      <li>Must not be disqualified under Section 164 of the Companies Act (e.g., director of a company that has failed to file returns for 3+ consecutive years)</li>
      <li>Minimum age: 18 years (no maximum age for private companies; listed companies have age limits)</li>
      <li>Must be a natural person — companies and LLPs cannot be directors</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>NRIs and foreign nationals</strong> can be directors in Indian companies — they need a DIN, and their identity documents need to be apostilled or notarised.</p>

    <h2 id="types">2. Types of Directors in a Company</h2>
    <table class="table">
      <tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Requirements</th></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Executive / Whole-time Director</strong></td><td>Works full-time in the company, draws salary</td><td>Board + shareholder approval, remuneration approval</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Non-Executive Director</strong></td><td>Does not work full-time; provides oversight and guidance</td><td>Board approval</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Additional Director</strong></td><td>Appointed by Board between two AGMs — holds office till next AGM</td><td>Board resolution only; regularised at next AGM</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Independent Director</strong></td><td>No relation to company/promoters; required for listed companies and large unlisted companies</td><td>Specific eligibility criteria; declaration required</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Nominee Director</strong></td><td>Appointed by investor/lender to represent their interests on the Board</td><td>As per SHA or loan agreement</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h2 id="procedure">3. Step-by-Step Appointment Procedure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1 — Obtain DIN:</strong> If the proposed director does not have a DIN, apply for DIN via Form DIR-3 on MCA portal (or SPICe+ at the time of company incorporation)</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2 — Obtain consent:</strong> The proposed director must give written consent to act as director in Form DIR-2</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3 — Board Meeting:</strong> Pass a Board Resolution approving the appointment — including the effective date, designation, and remuneration (if any)</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4 — Issue appointment letter:</strong> Issue a letter of appointment to the director</li>
      <li><strong>Step 5 — File DIR-12 with ROC:</strong> File Form DIR-12 on MCA portal within 30 days of appointment — attaching DIR-2 consent, ID proof, and board resolution</li>
      <li><strong>Step 6 — Update registers:</strong> Update the Register of Directors and KMP (Key Managerial Personnel)</li>
      <li><strong>Step 7 — Intimation to banks:</strong> Inform the company's bank of the change in authorised signatories if the new director is added as signatory</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="mini-cta"><p>Late filing of DIR-12 (beyond 30 days) attracts late fees — ₹100 per day per form, up to a maximum of ₹5,000. Our team ensures all director filings are completed on time.</p><a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20DIR-12%20filing%20for%20director%20appointment%20in%20my%20company">DIR-12 Filing Help &#8594;</a></div>

    <h2 id="forms">4. ROC Forms and Filings — DIR-12, DIR-2, DIN</h2>
    <table class="table">
      <tr><th>Form</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Timeline</th></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>DIR-3</strong></td><td>Application for DIN (if not already held)</td><td>Before appointment</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>DIR-2</strong></td><td>Consent to act as director — signed by proposed director</td><td>Before board meeting</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>DIR-12</strong></td><td>Intimation to ROC of new appointment / change in directors</td><td>Within 30 days of appointment</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>MGT-14</strong></td><td>Filing of Special Resolution (only if shareholders&#39; approval required)</td><td>Within 30 days of resolution</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>DIR-8</strong></td><td>Director&#39;s declaration of non-disqualification — filed with company annually</td><td>At first board meeting each year</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h2 id="removal">5. Removal / Resignation of Director</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Resignation:</strong> Director submits resignation notice to company → Board takes note → Company files DIR-12 within 30 days → Director may also file DIR-11 independently to protect themselves</li>
      <li><strong>Removal by shareholders:</strong> Requires ordinary resolution at general meeting with special notice of 14 days — director has right to be heard before removal (Section 169)</li>
      <li><strong>Vacation of office:</strong> Director automatically vacates office if they miss 3 consecutive Board Meetings without leave, become insolvent, or are convicted</li>
    </ul>
    <p>DIN deactivation: A director whose DIN is deactivated (due to non-filing of DIR-3 KYC) cannot be a director in any company until DIN is reactivated by filing DIR-3 KYC.</p>
