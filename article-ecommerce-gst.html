    <p>Selling on Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, Myntra, Nykaa, or your own website? GST compliance for e-commerce sellers in India is different from regular businesses — there are specific rules around mandatory GST registration, TCS (Tax Collected at Source) deductions by the platform, and special return filing requirements. This guide explains everything an online seller needs to know about GST in India.</p>

    <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Selling online?</strong> Our CA team handles complete GST and income tax compliance for e-commerce sellers on Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, and other platforms — across Hapur, UP, NCR, and pan-India. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20GST%20and%20tax%20compliance%20for%20my%20ecommerce%20business" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

    <h2 id="overview">1. E-commerce GST — The Key Rules</h2>
    <p>The GST law treats e-commerce sellers differently in two important ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No turnover threshold for GST registration:</strong> Normal businesses register for GST only when turnover exceeds ₹40 lakh (goods) or ₹20 lakh (services). But if you sell through an e-commerce operator (Amazon, Flipkart, etc.), you must register for GST regardless of turnover — even if you sell ₹1.</li>
      <li><strong>TCS deduction by the platform:</strong> E-commerce operators (Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, etc.) deduct 1% TCS (Tax Collected at Source) on the net value of sales made through their platform and deposit it with the government. This TCS appears in your GST credit ledger and can be offset against your GST liability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="tcs">2. TCS Under GST — Section 52</h2>
    <p>Under Section 52 of the CGST Act, every e-commerce operator must collect 1% TCS (0.5% CGST + 0.5% SGST for intra-state; 1% IGST for inter-state) on all taxable sales facilitated through their platform. Key points:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>TCS is deducted from the seller's payment — not charged to the buyer</li>
      <li>Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, Myntra, etc. file GSTR-8 monthly and deposit TCS to the government</li>
      <li>The TCS credit reflects in your GST credit ledger in GSTR-2B — you can use it to pay your GST liability or claim a refund</li>
      <li>If your TCS credit exceeds your GST liability, you can claim a refund</li>
      <li>Always reconcile your GSTR-2B TCS credit against your actual sales on each platform</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="mini-cta"><p>Missing TCS credit reconciliation? Many e-commerce sellers find their GSTR-2B TCS credit doesn't match their actual platform sales — leading to excess tax payment. Get your TCS reconciliation done by our CA team.</p><a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20TCS%20reconciliation%20and%20GST%20compliance%20for%20my%20ecommerce%20business">TCS Reconciliation Help &#8594;</a></div>

    <h2 id="registration">3. Mandatory GST Registration for E-commerce Sellers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>GST registration is mandatory for ALL e-commerce sellers regardless of turnover — from the first day of sale on any platform</li>
      <li>Exception: Sellers of exclusively exempt goods (e.g., fresh vegetables, eggs) or suppliers of services below ₹20 lakh using the composition scheme — but this is very limited</li>
      <li>You need a GSTIN before you can list on Amazon, Flipkart, or Meesho</li>
      <li>Multi-state selling: If you store inventory in multiple states (using FBA warehouses), you may need GST registration in each state where inventory is stored</li>
      <li>Own website selling: If you sell through your own website without using an e-commerce operator, normal turnover thresholds apply</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="returns">4. GST Returns for E-commerce Sellers</h2>
    <table class="table">
      <tr><th>Return</th><th>Frequency</th><th>What to Report</th></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>GSTR-1</strong></td><td>Monthly (or quarterly under QRMP)</td><td>All outward sales — B2B, B2C, exports</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>GSTR-3B</strong></td><td>Monthly</td><td>Summary of sales, purchases, ITC, tax payment</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>GSTR-9</strong></td><td>Annual</td><td>Annual reconciliation return</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>Key compliance checks for e-commerce sellers: GSTR-1 sales must match platform dashboard sales; GSTR-2B ITC/TCS credit must be reconciled with platform reports; HSN codes and tax rates must be correct for your product category.</p>

    <h2 id="itr">5. Income Tax for E-commerce Sellers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Business income:</strong> E-commerce selling income is taxable as business income</li>
      <li><strong>ITR-3 or ITR-4:</strong> Most e-commerce sellers file ITR-3 (regular books) or ITR-4 (presumptive taxation under 44AD — 8% or 6% of turnover as income)</li>
      <li><strong>Section 44AD:</strong> Sellers with turnover up to ₹3 crore (and digital receipts &gt;95%) can use presumptive taxation — no books of accounts required</li>
      <li><strong>Expenses deductible:</strong> Platform fees, shipping, packaging, advertising, storage, returns — all deductible from business income</li>
      <li><strong>TDS on commission:</strong> Amazon/Flipkart may deduct TDS on commissions paid to you — appears in Form 26AS</li>
    </ul>
