    <div class="content">
        <p>When a company takes a loan or borrows funds — and provides assets as security — the lender creates a legal "charge" over those assets. This charge must be registered with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) within prescribed timelines. Failure to register a charge makes it void against liquidators and creditors — potentially catastrophic for a lender and damaging for the company's credibility. This guide explains charge registration, modification, and satisfaction.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Taking a loan secured by assets?</strong> Charge registration with MCA within 30 days is mandatory. Our CA team files CHG-1 for companies across India — on time, every time. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20help%20with%20charge%20registration%20CHG-1%20filing" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="what-is">1. What is a Charge?</h2>
        <p>A charge is an interest or lien created on the assets of a company as security for money borrowed. When a bank, NBFC, or other lender extends a secured loan to a company and takes security over the company's property (land, building, machinery, receivables, stocks, or any other assets), a charge is created. The Companies Act requires every company to register such charges with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) so that the public — including future creditors and investors — can know about existing encumbrances on the company's assets.</p>

        <h2 id="types">2. Types of Charges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fixed Charge:</strong> Created on specific, identified assets — e.g., land and building, specific machinery. The company cannot dispose of these assets without the lender's consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Floating Charge:</strong> Created on a class of assets that changes from time to time — e.g., inventory (stock), trade receivables, cash. The company can use these assets in normal business until the charge "crystallises" on default.</li>
            <li><strong>Pari Passu Charge:</strong> Equal charge shared by multiple lenders — each has equal claim on the asset on default.</li>
            <li><strong>Subservient / Second Charge:</strong> Second charge on assets already under a first charge — paid only after the first charge holder is satisfied.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="registration">3. Charge Registration — Form CHG-1</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Who files:</strong> The company (as chargor) must file — though the lender (chargee) can also file</li>
            <li><strong>Form:</strong> CHG-1 (for charges other than debentures); CHG-9 (for debentures)</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Within <strong>30 days</strong> of creation of charge (extendable up to 60 days with additional fee)</li>
            <li><strong>Documents required:</strong> Loan agreement / sanction letter, charge creation document (hypothecation agreement, mortgage deed), board resolution authorising the charge</li>
            <li><strong>Fee:</strong> MCA fee depends on the amount of charge secured</li>
            <li><strong>Certificate of Registration (CHG-2):</strong> Issued by RoC on successful registration</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="mini-cta"><p>Missed the 30-day window? Condonation of delay is possible — but requires a court order or RD application. Act immediately to minimise complications.</p><a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20missed%20the%20charge%20registration%20deadline%20and%20need%20urgent%20help">Missed Deadline — Get Help &#8594;</a></div>

        <h2 id="modification">4. Charge Modification — CHG-1 (Modification)</h2>
        <p>When the terms of a charge are modified — interest rate change, additional assets included, revised loan amount, or change in lender details — the modification must be registered with the RoC within 30 days using CHG-1 (selecting "Modification" option). Key modification events include: additional facility on the same security, enhancement of credit limits, takeover by another bank, and consortium arrangements.</p>

        <h2 id="satisfaction">5. Charge Satisfaction — CHG-4</h2>
        <p>When a loan is fully repaid and the charge is released by the lender, the company must intimate the RoC about satisfaction (discharge) of the charge by filing <strong>Form CHG-4</strong> within 30 days of satisfaction. The lender must verify the satisfaction (they receive a notice and have 15 days to respond). On approval, the charge record in MCA is marked as satisfied — removing the encumbrance from the company's public record.</p>
