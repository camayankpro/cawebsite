        <p>A Tax Audit is one of the most important statutory compliances for businesses and professionals in India with income above prescribed thresholds. Required under Section 44AB of the Income Tax Act, a tax audit by a Chartered Accountant adds credibility to your accounts and ensures correctness of the income tax return filed. Whether you run a trading business in Mumbai, a manufacturing unit in Hapur, or a professional practice in Bengaluru — this guide explains everything you need to know about tax audit in India.</p>

        </div>

        <h2 id="what-is">1. What is Tax Audit Under Section 44AB?</h2>
        <p>A Tax Audit is the examination and verification of the accounts of a business or profession by a Chartered Accountant, for the purpose of ensuring that the accounts are true, correct, and comply with the provisions of the Income Tax Act. The Chartered Accountant who conducts the audit furnishes a report in the prescribed form (Form 3CA or 3CB along with Form 3CD), which is then submitted to the Income Tax Department before the due date of the Income Tax Return.</p>
        <p>The objective of a tax audit is not just to verify income — it requires the auditor to report on specific aspects of the business such as loans/advances, cash transactions above ₹2 lakh, payments liable for TDS, disallowances, depreciation, and much more.</p>

        <h2 id="who-needs">2. Who Needs a Tax Audit?</h2>
        <p>Tax audit under Section 44AB is mandatory when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Business Turnover Threshold (Section 44AB(a)):</strong> Total sales, turnover, or gross receipts in a business exceed <strong>₹1 crore</strong> in the financial year. This threshold is enhanced to <strong>₹10 crore</strong> if cash receipts and cash payments are each within 5% of total receipts/payments during the year (i.e., 95%+ transactions are digital/banking).</li>
            <li><strong>Profession Threshold (Section 44AB(b)):</strong> Gross receipts from a profession exceed <strong>₹50 lakh</strong> in the financial year.</li>
            <li><strong>Presumptive Taxation — Opting Out (Section 44AB(d) &amp; (e)):</strong> When a person covered under presumptive taxation schemes (44AD for business, 44ADA for professionals) declares income lower than the prescribed deemed profit AND their total income exceeds the basic exemption limit — tax audit is mandatory.</li>
            <li><strong>Losses with Carry Forward Intent:</strong> If a business reports a loss and wants to carry it forward, audit may be required depending on the quantum of turnover and income.</li>
        </ul>

        <table class="info-table">
            <tr><th>Category</th><th>Audit Trigger</th><th>Turnover/Receipt Threshold</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Business (mostly cash)</td><td>Section 44AB(a)</td><td>Turnover &gt; ₹1 crore</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Business (95%+ digital)</td><td>Section 44AB(a) proviso</td><td>Turnover &gt; ₹10 crore</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Profession</td><td>Section 44AB(b)</td><td>Gross Receipts &gt; ₹50 lakh</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Under 44AD / 44ADA (opting out)</td><td>Section 44AB(d)/(e)</td><td>Income below deemed profit + total income &gt; exemption limit</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h2 id="forms">3. Tax Audit Forms — 3CA, 3CB, and 3CD</h2>
        <h3>Form 3CA:</h3>
        <p>Used when the accounts of the business or profession are already required to be audited under any other law (e.g., under the Companies Act for companies, or under the LLP Act for LLPs). The CA certifies that the accounts have been audited under the relevant law and also complies with Section 44AB requirements.</p>

        <h3>Form 3CB:</h3>
        <p>Used when the accounts are NOT already audited under any other law — i.e., for proprietorships, partnership firms, and other entities not covered by mandatory audit under other statutes. The CA audits the books specifically for income tax purposes.</p>

        <h3>Form 3CD:</h3>
        <p>This is the detailed statement of particulars required to be furnished under Section 44AB — it is a comprehensive report accompanying either Form 3CA or 3CB. Form 3CD contains 44 clauses covering aspects such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>General business information and method of accounting</li>
            <li>Details of changes in accounting policies</li>
            <li>Amounts not credited to P&amp;L account</li>
            <li>Depreciation computation</li>
            <li>Amounts deductible under various sections</li>
            <li>Details of payments above ₹10,000 in cash (disallowable under Section 40A(3))</li>
            <li>TDS compliance details</li>
            <li>Loans and deposits in cash above ₹20,000</li>
            <li>Details of MSME dues outstanding more than 45 days</li>
            <li>Information about prior period income and expenses</li>
            <li>Details of deemed income</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box">
            <p>📋 <strong>Form 3CD is extensive</strong> and requires meticulous attention to detail. Incorrect or incomplete reporting in Form 3CD can lead to scrutiny notices and penalties. Our experienced CA team ensures accurate, thorough reporting. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20Tax%20Audit%20Form%203CD%20preparation%20services" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Get Form 3CD prepared by experts</a></p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="due-date">4. Tax Audit Due Date</h2>
        <p>The Tax Audit Report (Form 3CA/3CB + 3CD) must be uploaded on the Income Tax Portal by the Chartered Accountant and accepted by the taxpayer on or before <strong>31st October</strong> of the assessment year (for cases without transfer pricing). For cases with international/specified domestic transactions (requiring transfer pricing audit under Section 92E), the deadline is <strong>30th November</strong>.</p>
        <p>The ITR itself (for businesses and professionals requiring tax audit) must also be filed by 31st October (or 30th November for TP cases). Not filing the tax audit report by the due date is a separate default from late ITR filing.</p>

        <h2 id="penalty">5. Penalty for Non-Compliance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Penalty Under Section 271B:</strong> If a person who is required to get accounts audited fails to do so by the due date, a penalty equal to <strong>0.5% of total sales/turnover/gross receipts</strong> is levied — minimum ₹1.5 lakh and maximum ₹1.5 lakh (note: the maximum cap was revised; check current provisions).</li>
            <li>The penalty is not attracted if the taxpayer proves that there was reasonable cause for the failure.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the expense deductions may be disallowed and the return may be treated as defective.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box">
            <p>🚨 <strong>Planning to skip tax audit?</strong> Beyond the penalty, an un-audited return filed past the deadline loses the right to carry forward business losses, attract interest under 234A, and may trigger scrutiny. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20urgently%20need%20Tax%20Audit%20services%20for%20my%20business" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Get urgent tax audit done</a></p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="process">6. How Tax Audit Works — Our Process</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Document Collection:</strong> We collect your books of accounts, bank statements, invoices, TDS challans, and other records for the year.</li>

            <li><strong>Taxpayer Acceptance:</strong> You (the taxpayer) log in to the portal and accept the audit report.</li>
