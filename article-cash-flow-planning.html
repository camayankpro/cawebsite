        <p>Cash flow is the lifeblood of any business — profitable companies fail every year because they run out of cash, not because they lack customers or revenue. Cash Flow Planning is the strategic process of forecasting, monitoring, and actively managing the timing of cash inflows and outflows to ensure the business always has enough liquidity to meet its obligations, invest in growth, and weather downturns. This guide explains how businesses can build a robust cash flow management system.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Business is profitable but always short on cash?</strong> Our CA team builds monthly cash flow forecasts, identifies the root cause of your cash crunch, and creates an actionable plan to improve liquidity. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20help%20with%20Cash%20Flow%20Planning%20for%20my%20business" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="why">1. Why Profitable Businesses Run Out of Cash</h2>
        <p>The gap between profit and cash is real and often large. Here's why:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Long debtor days:</strong> You've made sales and booked profit — but the customer hasn't paid yet. Revenue in P&amp;L but no cash in bank.</li>
            <li><strong>Paying suppliers faster than collecting from customers:</strong> If you pay vendors in 15 days but collect from customers in 60 days, you are funding your customers' working capital with your own cash.</li>
            <li><strong>Inventory build-up:</strong> Raw materials and finished goods sitting in stock represent cash that hasn't turned into sales yet.</li>
            <li><strong>Rapid growth:</strong> Growing businesses need more working capital — inventory, debtors, and operating expenses all increase before revenue catches up.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonal business:</strong> Revenue peaks in certain months but expenses (rent, salaries, loan EMIs) continue throughout the year.</li>
            <li><strong>Capex funded from operations:</strong> Using daily cash for buying machinery or equipment — depleting working capital.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="forecast">2. The 13-Week Rolling Cash Flow Forecast</h2>
        <p>The most effective cash flow tool for SMEs is the <strong>13-week rolling cash flow forecast</strong> — a week-by-week projection of expected cash inflows and outflows for the next 13 weeks (approximately one quarter), updated every week. It answers the most important business question: <em>Will we have enough cash to meet all obligations over the next 90 days?</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cash inflows:</strong> Expected customer collections (based on invoice dates and typical payment patterns), advance receipts, loan disbursements, asset sales</li>
            <li><strong>Cash outflows:</strong> Supplier payments, salaries, GST/TDS payments, loan EMIs, rent, utilities, capex</li>
            <li><strong>Net cash position:</strong> Opening cash + inflows − outflows = closing cash — projected week by week</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum cash buffer:</strong> Set a minimum cash threshold (e.g., 2 weeks of operating expenses) — any week below this triggers action</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="improve">3. Practical Strategies to Improve Cash Flow</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduce debtor days:</strong> Invoice immediately on delivery, offer early payment discounts (1–2% for 10-day payment), send WhatsApp reminders on due date, escalate overdue accounts quickly</li>
            <li><strong>Extend creditor days (ethically):</strong> Negotiate 45–60 day payment terms with suppliers — use available credit period fully without defaulting</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce inventory levels:</strong> Just-in-time inventory where possible — excess stock ties up cash</li>
            <li><strong>Advance collections:</strong> For large orders, collect 30–50% advance before starting work or shipping</li>
            <li><strong>Use CC/OD facility wisely:</strong> Working capital bank facilities exist for short-term cash gaps — use them for temporary gaps, not long-term funding</li>
            <li><strong>Tax payment planning:</strong> Advance tax, GST, TDS — plan these outflows in the cash flow forecast so they don't create surprises</li>
            <li><strong>Defer capex:</strong> Lease or finance equipment instead of buying outright — preserve cash for working capital</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="mis">4. Cash Flow and MIS — Integrating with Monthly Management Reporting</h2>
        <p>Cash flow monitoring should be a standing item in your monthly MIS report — alongside P&amp;L and Balance Sheet. Monthly MIS should include: actual vs projected cash flow for the month, closing cash and bank position, debtors ageing (who owes you and for how long), creditors ageing (who you owe and when it's due), and next-month cash flow forecast. A business owner who reviews these monthly rarely gets surprised by a cash crisis.</p>
