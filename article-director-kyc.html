        <p>Director KYC (DIR-3 KYC) is a mandatory annual compliance for every individual holding a Director Identification Number (DIN) in India — regardless of whether they are currently active as a director or not. Failure to file DIR-3 KYC by September 30 every year results in immediate deactivation of the DIN — blocking the director from signing any MCA forms. This guide explains everything about Director KYC compliance.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>DIN deactivated or DIR-3 KYC due?</strong> Our CA team files Director KYC for individuals and companies across India — quickly and accurately. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20help%20with%20DIR-3%20KYC%20Director%20KYC%20filing" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="who-must">1. Who Must File Director KYC?</h2>
        <p>Every individual who holds a DIN (Director Identification Number) — whether the DIN was allotted in the current year or in any previous year — must file Director KYC annually. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Active directors of Pvt Ltd / Public Ltd / OPC / Section 8 companies</li>
            <li>Designated Partners of LLPs (holding DPIN/DIN)</li>
            <li>Disqualified directors — must still file KYC even if disqualified</li>
            <li>Directors of struck-off companies — must still file KYC for their DIN to remain active</li>
            <li>Individuals who obtained DIN but never took directorship — DIN still needs annual KYC</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="types">2. Forms: DIR-3 KYC vs KYC Web</h2>
        <table class="table">
            <tr><th>Form</th><th>When Used</th><th>Requirements</th></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>DIR-3 KYC</strong> (full form)</td><td>First KYC for a DIN, or when any details change (mobile, email, address)</td><td>DSC of director + CA attestation + Aadhaar OTP + PAN + address proof</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>DIR-3 KYC-Web</strong></td><td>Annual renewal when no details have changed</td><td>Login to MCA portal — OTP on registered mobile and email — no DSC needed</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>For most directors after the first year — KYC Web is sufficient — just an OTP verification on the MCA portal. The full DIR-3 KYC form (with DSC and CA certification) is needed only when mobile number, email ID, or address changes.</p>

        <div class="mini-cta"><p>Multiple directors in your company? Our team handles bulk Director KYC filing — all directors covered before the September 30 deadline.</p><a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20bulk%20Director%20KYC%20filing%20for%20all%20directors%20in%20my%20company">Bulk Director KYC Filing &#8594;</a></div>

        <h2 id="deadline">3. Deadline and Penalty</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Annual Deadline:</strong> 30th September every year</li>
            <li><strong>Consequence of non-filing:</strong> DIN is deactivated immediately after September 30 — the director cannot sign any MCA e-form until KYC is filed</li>
            <li><strong>Reactivation fee:</strong> ₹5,000 per DIN to reactivate a deactivated DIN (file DIR-3 KYC with ₹5,000 penalty)</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> A deactivated DIN means no ROC filings can be submitted by that director — blocking the company's annual compliance chain</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="documents">4. Documents for DIR-3 KYC (Full Form)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>PAN Card (mandatory)</li>
            <li>Aadhaar Card (for Aadhaar OTP authentication)</li>
            <li>Current mobile number and email ID (must be linked to Aadhaar)</li>
            <li>Passport (if foreign national)</li>
            <li>Residential address proof (Aadhaar / Passport / Voter ID / Driving Licence / Utility Bill)</li>
            <li>DSC (Digital Signature Certificate) of the director</li>
            <li>CA's DSC and membership number (for form certification)</li>
        </ul>
