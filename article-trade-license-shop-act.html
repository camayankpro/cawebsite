    <p>Every business operating a shop, office, establishment, restaurant, hotel, or commercial premises in Uttar Pradesh must register under the Uttar Pradesh Dukan Aur Vanijya Adhisthan Adhiniyam (Shops and Establishment Act). Commonly known as Shop Act Registration or Trade License, this is one of the primary business registrations required before you start operations. This guide explains the complete process for Uttar Pradesh — including Hapur, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Noida, Lucknow, and all other cities in UP.</p>

    <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Opening a shop, office, or business in UP?</strong> Our CA team handles Trade License and Shop Act registration for businesses across Hapur, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Noida, Bulandshahr, and all of Uttar Pradesh. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20Trade%20License%20and%20Shop%20Act%20Registration%20in%20UP" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

    <h2 id="what-is">1. What is Trade License / Shop Act Registration?</h2>
    <p>Shop Act Registration (also called Trade License or Gumasta License in some states) is a legal requirement under the Uttar Pradesh Shops and Commercial Establishments Act. It is a government certificate that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Legally authorises you to operate a commercial establishment at the registered address</li>
      <li>Regulates working hours, holidays, leave entitlements, and employment conditions for employees</li>
      <li>Is required to open a current bank account for most private and nationalised banks in UP</li>
      <li>Is required for other registrations like GST, FSSAI, and professional tax</li>
      <li>Is required for renewal of lease agreements and commercial property</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="applicability">2. Who Needs to Register Under Shop Act in UP?</h2>
    <p>Registration is required for all commercial establishments in Uttar Pradesh, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Retail and wholesale shops</li>
      <li>Restaurants, hotels, dhabas, bakeries, and food establishments</li>
      <li>Trading offices, service centres, and showrooms</li>
      <li>Private companies, LLPs, and partnership firms operating offices</li>
      <li>Factories not covered under the Factories Act</li>
      <li>Professionals like CAs, doctors, lawyers operating offices</li>
      <li>Home-based businesses with employees or commercial activity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Establishments employing even one worker (other than family members) are required to register. Many businesses register even without employees — as it is needed for bank accounts and other compliance.</p>

    <h2 id="documents">3. Documents Required for Shop Act Registration in UP</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Identity proof of proprietor/partners/directors (Aadhaar, PAN)</li>
      <li>Address proof of the business premises (electricity bill, rent agreement, property tax receipt)</li>
      <li>Rent agreement (if rented premises)</li>
      <li>Photograph of the owner/authorised signatory</li>
      <li>PAN card of the business/individual</li>
      <li>Nature of business description</li>
      <li>Number of employees (can be zero for sole proprietors)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="process">4. Registration Process in Uttar Pradesh</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the UP Labour Department's online portal (uplabour.gov.in) or apply at the local District Labour Office</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Fill Form A (Application for Registration) — providing establishment details, address, nature of business, and employee count</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Upload documents — identity proof, address proof of premises, rent agreement</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pay registration fees (based on number of employees — typically ₹125 to ₹1,250 for UP)</li>
      <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Submit application — processed by the Inspector under the Shops and Establishments Act</li>
      <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Certificate issued — typically within 7–15 working days</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The UP government has been progressively moving this process online through the Nivesh Mitra portal and the Labour Department portal. Our team is current with the process across all UP districts.</p>

    <h2 id="renewal">5. Renewal and Penalties</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Shop Act Registration in UP must be renewed annually before expiry</li>
      <li>Renewal fee is similar to registration fee — based on employee count</li>
      <li>Change in address, nature of business, or employee count must be intimated to the Labour Department</li>
      <li>Operating without registration: Fine up to ₹1,000 for first offence; higher penalties for repeat violations</li>
      <li>The Registration Certificate must be displayed prominently at the business premises</li>
    </ul>
