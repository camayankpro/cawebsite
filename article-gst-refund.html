        <p>GST Refund is the process by which a GST-registered taxpayer can recover excess GST paid — whether due to exports, inverted duty structure, excess tax paid by mistake, or supplies to SEZ units. India's GST law provides a well-defined refund mechanism, but the process involves multiple forms, documentary requirements, and timelines that can be complex to navigate. This guide explains GST refund eligibility, process, documents, and timelines — for exporters, manufacturers, and businesses dealing with inverted duty structure.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>GST refund pending or rejected?</strong> Our CA team prepares and files GST refund applications — for exporters, SEZ suppliers, and inverted duty cases — with complete documentation across India. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20help%20with%20GST%20Refund%20application" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="who-can">1. Who Can Claim GST Refund?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exporters of goods (with payment of IGST):</strong> IGST paid on exports is refunded automatically based on shipping bill data — no separate application needed if PAN, bank details, and GSTR-1 are correctly filed.</li>
            <li><strong>Exporters under LUT/Bond (zero-rated without payment of tax):</strong> ITC accumulated on inputs used for exports is refunded via RFD-01 application.</li>
            <li><strong>Suppliers to SEZ Units/Developers:</strong> Zero-rated supply — IGST refund or accumulated ITC refund.</li>
            <li><strong>Inverted Duty Structure (IDS) cases:</strong> When GST rate on inputs is higher than on outputs — ITC accumulates without utilisation. Refund of accumulated ITC is available.</li>
            <li><strong>Excess tax paid by mistake:</strong> Refund of tax paid erroneously through wrong GSTIN, wrong tax head, or duplicate payment.</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-deposit refund after appellate order:</strong> If appeal is decided in your favour — pre-deposit refund available.</li>
            <li><strong>Refund of tax on supply declared as exempt:</strong> When a supply taxed earlier is declared exempt retrospectively.</li>
        </ul>
