        <h2 id="what-is">1. What is a Scrutiny Assessment?</h2>
        <p>A scrutiny assessment (formally called "Assessment under Section 143(3)" of the Income Tax Act) is a detailed examination of a taxpayer's Income Tax Return by an Assessing Officer (AO) of the Income Tax Department. During this process, the AO verifies the correctness of income declared, deductions claimed, and taxes paid — by calling for supporting documents and explanations.</p>
        <p>The process begins with the issuance of a notice under Section 143(2), which must be served within a prescribed period from the date of filing the return. The AO then calls for specific documents, books, and explanations through notices under Section 142(1). After examining the evidence and hearing the taxpayer, the AO passes an assessment order either accepting the return as filed or making additions/disallowances to the declared income.</p>

        <h2 id="types">2. Types of Assessments and Notices</h2>

        <h3>Section 143(1) — Intimation (Not Scrutiny):</h3>
        <p>This is an automated processing of your return by the CPC (Centralised Processing Centre). It may result in a refund, demand, or "no demand no refund" message. This is NOT a scrutiny notice — it's routine and does not require detailed documentation.</p>

        <h3>Section 143(2) — Notice for Scrutiny:</h3>
        <p>This is the actual scrutiny notice. It means your return has been selected for detailed examination. The AO will call for documents, books of accounts, and explanations. The selection can be through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Computer-Assisted Scrutiny Selection (CASS):</strong> Risk-based automated selection by the Income Tax Department's computer system based on specific risk parameters.</li>
            <li><strong>Manual Scrutiny:</strong> Cases flagged by AOs for specific issues — large deductions, mismatch with AIR data, unusual transactions, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Section 147 — Reassessment (Income Escaping Assessment):</h3>
        <p>When the AO has reason to believe that income has escaped assessment, they can reopen a previously assessed year. This can be done up to 3 years (or up to 10 years in cases involving foreign assets or large amounts) from the end of the relevant assessment year.</p>

        <h3>Section 148 — Notice for Reassessment:</h3>
        <p>Issued when income is believed to have escaped assessment. You are asked to file a fresh return, after which the AO conducts a detailed inquiry.</p>

        <table class="info-table">
            <tr><th>Notice Section</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Time Limit for Issue</th></tr>
            <tr><td>143(1)</td><td>Intimation — automated processing result</td><td>Within 9 months from end of FY of filing</td></tr>
            <tr><td>143(2)</td><td>Scrutiny selection notice</td><td>Within 3 months from end of FY of filing</td></tr>
            <tr><td>142(1)</td><td>Requisition for documents during scrutiny</td><td>During scrutiny proceedings</td></tr>
            <tr><td>148</td><td>Reassessment — escaped income</td><td>Up to 3 years (10 years for large/foreign cases)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>156</td><td>Notice of Demand — after assessment order</td><td>After passing of order</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h2 id="reasons">3. Common Reasons for Scrutiny Selection</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High-value cash deposits</strong> in bank accounts not matching declared income</li>
            <li><strong>Large deductions</strong> claimed under Section 80C, 80G, donations, etc. that appear disproportionate to income</li>
            <li><strong>Mismatch between AIS/Form 26AS</strong> and declared income — interest, dividends, capital gains not reported</li>
            <li><strong>Property transactions</strong> — purchase/sale at values significantly different from circle rates</li>
            <li><strong>Significant losses</strong> claimed in business or capital gains, especially carry-forward losses</li>
            <li><strong>Foreign assets or income</strong> — overseas investments, FEMA compliance issues</li>
            <li><strong>Large professional fees or turnover</strong> with disproportionately low profit margins</li>
            <li><strong>Non-filing or late filing</strong> of returns despite high-value transactions in financial statements</li>
            <li><strong>High-value purchases or lifestyle indicators</strong> not matching income levels</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box">
            <p>⚠️ <strong>Did you know?</strong> With the Annual Information Statement (AIS) now capturing data from banks, registrars, SEBI, MCA, and more — the tax department has vastly improved data on every taxpayer. Mismatches are automatically flagged. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20want%20to%20review%20my%20AIS%20and%20ensure%20my%20ITR%20is%20correct%20to%20avoid%20scrutiny" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Review your AIS with our CA team</a></p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="process">4. The Scrutiny Assessment Process</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Notice u/s 143(2):</strong> Received on your registered email / income tax portal. You must respond within the prescribed time.</li>
            <li><strong>Notice u/s 142(1):</strong> Specific information and documents are requisitioned — books of accounts, bank statements, invoices, deduction proofs, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Submission of Documents:</strong> All required documents are submitted through the ITBA (Income Tax Business Application) portal or in person, along with written explanations.</li>
            <li><strong>Hearing:</strong> The AO may call for a personal hearing to discuss specific issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Show Cause Notice:</strong> Before making any addition to income, the AO issues a show cause notice giving you an opportunity to explain.</li>
            <li><strong>Assessment Order:</strong> The AO passes a final order — either accepting the return or making additions. If additions are made, a demand notice under Section 156 follows.</li>
            <li><strong>Appeal Options:</strong> If you disagree with the order, you can appeal to CIT(A) → ITAT → High Court → Supreme Court.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="response">5. How to Respond to a Scrutiny Notice Effectively</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Never ignore a notice.</strong> Non-response leads to ex-parte assessment — the AO decides without your input, almost always resulting in heavy additions.</li>
            <li><strong>Respond within the deadline</strong> mentioned in the notice. Request extensions in advance if needed, citing genuine reasons.</li>
            <li><strong>Organise all supporting documents</strong> meticulously — every deduction claimed, every income source declared, every transaction questioned must have documentary backing.</li>
            <li><strong>Write clear, factual explanations</strong> — avoid ambiguity and never make statements that could be used against you later.</li>
            <li><strong>Engage a CA or tax advocate</strong> to represent you — they understand the legal provisions, know which arguments hold weight, and present your case professionally.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-reference your response with AIS/Form 26AS</strong> — ensure all third-party data matches what you've declared.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box">
            <p>🎯 <strong>The quality of your response to a scrutiny notice determines the outcome.</strong> A well-documented, legally sound response can close the matter at the AO level itself — avoiding appeals and further proceedings. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20expert%20CA%20representation%20for%20my%20Income%20Tax%20scrutiny%20assessment" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Get professional representation now</a></p>

        <h2 id="penalties">6. Consequences of Adverse Assessment Order</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tax Demand:</strong> Additional tax on the additions made to income, plus applicable surcharge and cess.</li>
            <li><strong>Interest (Section 234B):</strong> Interest from 1st April of assessment year till date of payment.</li>
            <li><strong>Penalty (Section 270A):</strong> 50% of tax on under-reported income; 200% if income is misreported (deliberate concealment).</li>
            <li><strong>Prosecution:</strong> In extreme cases of wilful tax evasion, criminal prosecution with imprisonment.</li>
        </ul>
