        <p>Receiving an Income Tax notice triggers anxiety in most taxpayers — but most notices are routine, non-adversarial, and easily resolved with a correct, timely response. Ignoring a notice, however, can convert a simple query into a full assessment, tax demand, penalty, and prosecution. This guide explains the most common income tax notices Indian taxpayers receive, what they mean, and exactly how to respond — so you can approach each with confidence instead of panic.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Received an income tax notice?</strong> Don't ignore it. Our CA team analyses your notice, prepares a complete response with supporting documents, and represents you before the Income Tax Department across India. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20received%20an%20Income%20Tax%20notice%20and%20need%20urgent%20CA%20help" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

            <tr><th>Section</th><th>Notice Type</th><th>What It Means</th><th>Response Deadline</th></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>143(1)</strong></td><td>Intimation — not really a notice</td><td>Auto-processed result of your ITR — shows tax payable or refund. Not adversarial.</td><td>No response needed unless demand raised</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>143(2)</strong></td><td>Scrutiny Notice</td><td>Your return is selected for detailed scrutiny — officer will examine your income, deductions, and claims</td><td>Must respond within 15 days</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>148 / 148A</strong></td><td>Reassessment Notice</td><td>Officer believes income escaped assessment in a past year — proposes to reopen that year's assessment</td><td>148A(b): Reply within 7 days; 148: File return within 3 months</td></tr>

        <h2 id="ais-mismatch">2. Notices Due to AIS / 26AS Mismatch — Most Common Today</h2>
        <p>The Annual Information Statement (AIS) captures almost every financial transaction — property purchases and sales, high-value cash deposits, mutual fund redemptions, share transactions, foreign remittances, interest income, GST turnover, and more. The Income Tax Department cross-references your ITR with your AIS. If a high-value transaction in your AIS is not reflected in your ITR, an automated notice under Section 133(6) or 142(1) is issued asking for explanation.</p>
        <p><strong>Common AIS mismatch situations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Property purchased or sold — not reported in ITR (capital gains omitted)</li>
            <li>Large cash deposits in bank account not explained by income</li>
            <li>Interest income from FDs not included in ITR</li>
            <li>Share/MF redemptions appearing as income not reported</li>
            <li>GST turnover far exceeding income declared in ITR</li>
            <li>Freelance/professional income received as UPI or bank transfer not reported</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="how-respond">3. How to Respond to an Income Tax Notice</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Never ignore:</strong> Ignoring a notice leads to ex-parte assessment — the officer decides based on available data alone — always against you</li>
            <li><strong>Read carefully:</strong> Understand the section, the specific issue raised, and the deadline</li>
            <li><strong>Gather documents:</strong> Bank statements, purchase invoices, sale deeds, Form 26AS, TDS certificates, books of accounts — collect everything relevant</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare a point-by-point written response:</strong> Address each issue raised by the officer — supported by documentary evidence</li>
            <li><strong>Submit online:</strong> Most responses are submitted on the Income Tax Portal (the official government portal) under "Pending Actions"</li>
            <li><strong>Engage a CA:</strong> For 143(2) scrutiny, 148 reassessment, and 131 summons — always engage a CA to represent you</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="mini-cta"><p>A professional CA response to a scrutiny notice reduces the risk of addition by 80-90% compared to self-response. Our team has handled hundreds of assessments and notices.</p><a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20a%20CA%20to%20respond%20to%20my%20income%20tax%20notice%20on%20my%20behalf">Respond to My IT Notice &#8594;</a></div>

        <h2 id="appeal">4. What If You Disagree with the Assessment Order?</h2>
        <p>If the Assessing Officer passes an unfavourable order after scrutiny — adding income or disallowing deductions — you have the right to appeal. The appeal hierarchy is: <strong>CIT(Appeals) → ITAT (Income Tax Appellate Tribunal) → High Court → Supreme Court</strong>. Time limit for filing appeal before CIT(A) is 30 days from receipt of assessment order. A pre-deposit of 20% of disputed demand is required. Our CA team files and argues appeals before CIT(A) and ITAT.</p>
