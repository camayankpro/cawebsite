        <p>GST Registration is the gateway to legally conducting business under India's unified Goods and Services Tax regime. Whether you're a trader in Hapur, a service provider in Delhi NCR, a manufacturer in Western UP, or a startup anywhere in India — getting GST registered at the right time protects you from penalties, unlocks Input Tax Credit, and makes your business credible to buyers. This guide covers everything about GST registration — applicability, documents, types, process, and deadlines.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Need GST registration?</strong> Our CA team registers businesses for GST across India — correctly, quickly, and with proper category selection. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20GST%20Registration%20for%20my%20business" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="who-needs">1. Who Must Register for GST?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Turnover threshold:</strong> ₹40 lakh for goods (₹20 lakh for services; ₹10 lakh for special category states like Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura)</li>
            <li><strong>Inter-state supply:</strong> Any business making inter-state taxable supplies — regardless of turnover</li>
            <li><strong>E-commerce operators and sellers:</strong> All sellers on Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, Myntra — regardless of turnover</li>
            <li><strong>Casual taxable persons:</strong> Those making occasional taxable supplies in India</li>
            <li><strong>Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM) recipients:</strong> Those receiving supplies on which they must pay GST under RCM</li>
            <li><strong>Non-resident taxable persons</strong> supplying goods/services in India</li>
            <li><strong>Import of services:</strong> Any person importing taxable services</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even below the threshold, <strong>voluntary GST registration</strong> is advisable for B2B businesses — as unregistered suppliers cannot charge GST, blocking their buyers' ITC and often costing them contracts.</p>

        <h2 id="types">2. Types of GST Registration</h2>
        <table class="table">
            <tr><th>Type</th><th>For Whom</th><th>Key Feature</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Regular Registration</td><td>Most businesses above threshold</td><td>Collect GST, claim ITC, file monthly/quarterly returns</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Composition Scheme</td><td>Small businesses ≤ ₹1.5 crore turnover</td><td>Pay tax at flat rate (1–5%), no ITC, quarterly returns</td></tr>
            <tr><td>QRMP Scheme</td><td>Turnover ≤ ₹5 crore</td><td>Quarterly returns with monthly tax payment</td></tr>

            <tr><td>TDS/TCS Deductor</td><td>Government entities, e-commerce operators</td><td>Separate registration for TDS/TCS deduction</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h2 id="documents">3. Documents Required for GST Registration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>PAN of the business / applicant</li>
            <li>Aadhaar of proprietor / partners / directors (Aadhaar-linked mobile required for OTP)</li>
            <li>Proof of business registration (Partnership Deed / MOA / LLP Agreement / Udyam certificate)</li>
            <li>Address proof of principal place of business: electricity bill, rent agreement + NOC from landlord, or ownership document</li>
            <li>Bank account details: cancelled cheque or bank statement</li>
            <li>Photograph of proprietor / authorised signatory</li>

        <h2 id="process">4. GST Registration Process</h2>
        <div class="box"><p>&#128221; <strong>End-to-end handled by our CA team.</strong> Our team manages the complete filing, submission, and follow-up process on your behalf — so you can focus on your business. Get in touch with us for a free initial consultation.</p></div>
        <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 3–7 working days for Aadhaar-authenticated applications. Up to 30 days if physical verification required.</p>

        <h2 id="penalty">5. Penalty for Non-Registration</h2>
        <p>Operating without GST registration when mandatory attracts a penalty of <strong>10% of tax due (minimum ₹10,000)</strong> and in cases of deliberate tax evasion, <strong>100% of tax amount</strong>. All invoices issued without GSTIN are invalid for ITC purposes — your buyers lose ITC on purchases from you.</p>

        <div class="box warn"><p>&#9888;&#65039; <strong>GST registration is required before making the first taxable supply</strong> — not when you cross the threshold. Retrospective registration demands can include penalties on all past taxable supplies. Register early, stay compliant.</p></div>
