        <p>The Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is one of India's most versatile and popular business structures — combining the operational flexibility of a partnership with the limited liability protection of a company. Since its introduction under the LLP Act, 2008, the LLP has become the preferred structure for professional services firms, small businesses, startups, and businesses where partners want protection without the full regulatory burden of a Private Limited Company. This guide explains LLP registration, advantages, and compliance in full.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Want to register an LLP?</strong> Our CA team provides complete LLP registration services — from name approval and DSC to LLP Agreement drafting and incorporation certificate — for clients across India. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20want%20to%20register%20an%20LLP" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Start LLP registration on WhatsApp</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="what-is">1. What is an LLP?</h2>
        <p>A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is a body corporate formed and incorporated under the LLP Act, 2008. It has a separate legal identity from its partners — can own assets, enter contracts, and sue/be sued in its own name. Partners are liable only to the extent of their agreed contribution to the LLP — personal assets are protected from LLP liabilities (subject to exceptions for fraud or wrongful acts).</p>
        <p>Unlike a traditional partnership, an LLP is not dissolved by the death, insolvency, or resignation of a partner. The LLP continues to exist — making it a more stable business structure than a partnership firm.</p>

        <h2 id="advantages">2. Advantages of LLP</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Limited Liability:</strong> Partners' personal assets are protected from business debts — unlike in a traditional partnership.</li>
            <li><strong>Separate Legal Entity:</strong> LLP has its own legal identity — assets and liabilities are of the LLP, not the partners.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> LLP Agreement can be customised — profit sharing, management, admission/exit of partners is governed by the agreement, not rigid statutory rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Lower Compliance than Pvt Ltd:</strong> No mandatory statutory audit unless turnover exceeds ₹40 lakh or contribution exceeds ₹25 lakh. No AGM requirement. Simpler ROC filings.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax Efficiency:</strong> LLP is taxed at a flat rate of 30% on profits (plus surcharge/cess) — partners' share of LLP profit is exempt from tax in their individual hands (no dividend distribution tax). Remuneration and interest to partners is deductible subject to limits.</li>
            <li><strong>Ideal for Professional Firms:</strong> CA firms, law firms, consulting firms, architecture firms — LLP is the preferred structure for regulated professions.</li>
            <li><strong>No Minimum Capital:</strong> No prescribed minimum capital requirement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="requirements">3. Requirements for LLP Registration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Minimum 2 Partners</strong> (no maximum limit). At least one partner must be an Indian resident.</li>
            <li><strong>Designated Partners:</strong> Minimum 2 Designated Partners — responsible for regulatory compliance. Must be individuals (not corporate entities).</li>
            <li><strong>DPIN (Designated Partner Identification Number):</strong> All Designated Partners must have a DPIN.</li>
            <li><strong>DSC:</strong> At least one Designated Partner must have a DSC for online filing.</li>
            <li><strong>Registered Office in India.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>LLP Agreement:</strong> Governs the rights, duties, and obligations of partners — must be filed with the MCA within 30 days of incorporation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="process">4. LLP Registration Process</h2>
