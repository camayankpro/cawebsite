        <p>One of the most important — yet frequently overlooked — aspects of tax compliance for businesses and high-income individuals in India is Advance Tax. Unlike TDS (where someone else deducts the tax), advance tax is your own responsibility to estimate, calculate, and pay in quarterly instalments. Proper advance tax planning not only keeps you compliant but also prevents substantial interest outgo under Sections 234B and 234C of the Income Tax Act. This guide explains everything you need to know about advance tax planning in India.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <p>💡 <strong>Advance tax planning done wrong can cost lakhs in interest.</strong> Our CA team provides proactive advance tax planning and computation for businesses and individuals across India. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20Advance%20Tax%20Planning%20services" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Chat with us on WhatsApp</a></p>

        <h2 id="what-is">1. What is Advance Tax?</h2>
        <p>Advance Tax is the income tax payable in the same financial year in which the income is earned, as opposed to paying all tax at the end of the year. It is a system of "pay as you earn" — you estimate your total income for the year and pay tax in quarterly instalments throughout the year.</p>
        <p>The concept ensures the government receives a steady stream of tax revenue rather than a lump sum at year-end, and prevents taxpayers from keeping the full tax amount invested throughout the year. Every taxpayer whose estimated tax liability for the year exceeds ₹10,000 (after TDS and other credits) is required to pay advance tax.</p>

        <h2 id="who-pays">2. Who Needs to Pay Advance Tax?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Salaried individuals:</strong> Usually not required if employer deducts TDS on full salary. But mandatory if they have other income (interest, capital gains, rental, freelance) where TDS is insufficient.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-employed individuals and professionals:</strong> Doctors, lawyers, consultants, freelancers, and other professionals with significant non-TDS income.</li>
            <li><strong>Business owners (Proprietors, Partners):</strong> Anyone running a business where income is not subject to adequate TDS.</li>
            <li><strong>Companies and LLPs:</strong> All companies and LLPs must pay advance tax regardless of income amount.</li>
            <li><strong>Capital gain earners:</strong> Individuals who realise capital gains (from shares, mutual funds, property) mid-year must pay advance tax on such gains.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxpayers under Presumptive Scheme (Section 44AD/44ADA):</strong> Eligible for a simplified advance tax — pay the entire estimated tax in a single instalment by 15th March instead of four instalments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Exemptions from Advance Tax:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Senior citizens (60 years or above) who do <strong>not</strong> have income from business or profession are exempt from advance tax — they can pay all tax at the time of filing.</li>
            <li>Any taxpayer whose estimated tax liability (after TDS) is ₹10,000 or less is not required to pay advance tax.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="due-dates">3. Advance Tax Due Dates and Instalments</h2>
        <table class="info-table">
            <tr><th>Instalment</th><th>Due Date</th><th>Cumulative % of Estimated Tax Liability</th></tr>
            <tr><td>1st Instalment</td><td>15th June</td><td>At least 15%</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2nd Instalment</td><td>15th September</td><td>At least 45%</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3rd Instalment</td><td>15th December</td><td>At least 75%</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4th Instalment</td><td>15th March</td><td>100%</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Presumptive taxpayers (44AD/44ADA)</td><td>15th March only</td><td>100% in single payment</td></tr>
        </table>

        <div class="box">
            <p>⚠️ <strong>Capital gains are special:</strong> If you realise capital gains (say from selling property or shares) in Q3, you must compute and pay the advance tax on those gains by the Q3 due date (15th December) — even if it was not part of your original estimate. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20have%20capital%20gains%20and%20need%20advance%20tax%20planning" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Get capital gains tax planning</a></p>

        <h2 id="calculation">4. How to Calculate Advance Tax</h2>
        <p>Advance tax computation involves estimating your total income for the financial year and computing the tax on it. Here is a simplified step-by-step approach:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1 — Estimate Total Income:</strong> Project your income from all sources — salary, business/profession, capital gains, rental income, interest, dividends, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2 — Claim Deductions:</strong> Subtract eligible deductions (Section 80C, 80D, 80G, 24b, etc.) under the applicable tax regime (old or new).</li>
            
            <li><strong>Step 4 — Add Surcharge and Cess:</strong> Add applicable surcharge (for income above ₹50 lakh for individuals) and 4% Health &amp; Education Cess.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5 — Deduct TDS:</strong> Subtract the TDS already deducted or expected to be deducted during the year.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 6 — Net Advance Tax:</strong> If the remaining tax exceeds ₹10,000, this is your advance tax liability — to be paid in the prescribed instalments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="interest">5. Interest Penalties for Advance Tax Defaults</h2>
        <p>Missing advance tax instalments or underpaying them attracts significant interest under two provisions:</p>

        <h3>Section 234B — Shortfall in Total Advance Tax:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Applicable when total advance tax paid is less than 90% of the assessed tax liability.</li>
            <li>Interest at <strong>1% per month</strong> from 1st April of the assessment year till the date of actual payment/assessment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Section 234C — Deferment of Advance Tax Instalments:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Applicable when individual instalments are short-paid compared to prescribed percentages.</li>
            <li>Interest at <strong>1% per month</strong> for 3 months on the shortfall at each instalment (1 month for the last instalment in March).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box">
            <p>💰 <strong>Example:</strong> If your total tax liability is ₹5,00,000 and you paid zero advance tax, the interest under Section 234B alone could be ₹30,000–₹60,000 depending on when you pay — money you could have saved with proper planning. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20want%20to%20compute%20my%20advance%20tax%20and%20avoid%20interest" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Compute my advance tax now</a></p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="strategies">6. Advance Tax Planning Strategies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mid-Year Income Review:</strong> Don't wait for year-end. Review your income and tax liability at each instalment date and adjust payments accordingly.</li>
            <li><strong>Investment Planning:</strong> Make planned investments (80C, 80D, NPS, etc.) before the advance tax due dates so deductions can be factored in accurately.</li>
            <li><strong>Capital Gains Timing:</strong> If possible, defer realisation of capital gains to the next financial year or to a quarter where you have lower other income.</li>
            <li><strong>TDS Optimisation:</strong> Ensure clients and banks deduct adequate TDS on your receipts — this reduces your advance tax obligation automatically.</li>
            <li><strong>Regime Selection:</strong> The choice between old and new tax regime significantly affects your tax liability. Make this decision before the first instalment.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Over-Paying:</strong> While it's safe to pay slightly more than required (excess is refunded with 6% interest), avoid extreme overpayments that lock up cash unnecessarily.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="payment">7. How to Pay Advance Tax</h2>
        <p>Advance tax is paid through the Income Tax Department's online portal using Challan ITNS 280. You select "Advance Tax" as the type of payment and your PAN, assessment year, and payment details. The payment can be made through net banking or debit card. After payment, keep the challan counterfoil safe as it serves as proof of payment and is needed while filing your ITR.</p>
