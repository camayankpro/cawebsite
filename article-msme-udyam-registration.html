        <p>Udyam Registration (formerly MSME Registration / Udyog Aadhaar) is the official government recognition for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in India. It is free, fully online, and self-certified — and unlocks a powerful range of benefits including priority sector bank lending, protection against delayed payments, government tender preferences, and various scheme subsidies. If you're a business owner who hasn't registered yet, you're leaving significant money and protection on the table. This guide explains everything about Udyam Registration.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Get your MSME / Udyam certificate today.</strong> Our CA team registers businesses on the Udyam portal across India — quickly and correctly. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20Udyam%20MSME%20Registration%20for%20my%20business" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="classification">1. MSME Classification — Micro, Small, or Medium?</h2>
        <table class="table">
            <tr><th>Category</th><th>Investment in Plant &amp; Machinery/Equipment</th><th>Annual Turnover</th></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Micro Enterprise</strong></td><td>Up to ₹1 crore</td><td>Up to ₹5 crore</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Small Enterprise</strong></td><td>Up to ₹10 crore</td><td>Up to ₹50 crore</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Medium Enterprise</strong></td><td>Up to ₹50 crore</td><td>Up to ₹250 crore</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>Both conditions (investment AND turnover) must be within the limit for the respective category. If either exceeds the limit for a category, the enterprise graduates to the next category.</p>

        <h2 id="benefits">2. Key Benefits of Udyam Registration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Priority Sector Lending:</strong> Banks are mandated to lend a prescribed percentage to MSMEs — registered businesses get easier access to working capital and term loans at competitive rates</li>
            <li><strong>MSMED Act Protection — 45-Day Payment Rule:</strong> If your buyer is a company or large enterprise, they must pay you within 45 days. If they delay, they must pay compound interest at 3x the RBI bank rate — a powerful tool for small suppliers</li>
            <li><strong>Government Tender Preferences:</strong> Public procurement tenders reserve a percentage for MSME suppliers — and many tenders exempt MSMEs from EMD (Earnest Money Deposit)</li>
            <li><strong>Credit Guarantee (CGTMSE):</strong> Collateral-free loans up to ₹2 crore available through CGTMSE scheme for registered MSMEs</li>
            <li><strong>Subsidy on Patent Registration:</strong> 50% rebate on patent filing fees for MSMEs</li>
            <li><strong>Subsidy on ISO Certification:</strong> Reimbursement of ISO certification expenses available in many states</li>
            <li><strong>Lower electricity tariffs:</strong> Many states offer concessional electricity rates for MSME-registered units</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced interest rate on OD:</strong> 1–2% interest subvention under various government schemes for MSMEs</li>
            <li><strong>Protection against delayed payments via MSME Samadhaan:</strong> Free dispute resolution portal for delayed payment recovery</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="process">3. Udyam Registration Process</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Completely online — portal: <strong>the official government portal</strong></li>
            <li>Based on <strong>self-declaration</strong> — no documents need to be uploaded</li>
            <li>Requires <strong>Aadhaar of proprietor / partner / director</strong> and PAN of the enterprise</li>
            <li>GST and ITR data is auto-fetched from government databases — no manual entry of turnover/investment</li>
            <li>Udyam Registration Certificate issued immediately on successful registration</li>
            <li><strong>Registration is free of cost</strong> — no government fee</li>
            <li>Udyam Registration Number (URN) is permanent — no renewal required (unlike old Udyog Aadhaar)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="who">4. Who Can Register?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Proprietorships, Partnership Firms, HUFs</li>
            <li>Private Limited Companies, Public Companies, OPCs</li>
            <li>LLPs, Cooperative Societies, Trusts, and other associations</li>
            <li>Any business that qualifies under MSME investment and turnover limits</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Existing Udyog Aadhaar registrations have been migrated to Udyam — but if migration hasn't been done, re-register on the Udyam portal with updated PAN and GST details.</p>
