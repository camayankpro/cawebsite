        <h2 id="who-needs">1. Who Must Register for GST in Hapur?</h2>
        <p>As per the GST Act, 2017, the following businesses in Hapur are required to obtain GST registration:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Turnover threshold:</strong> Annual turnover above ₹40 lakh for goods suppliers and above ₹20 lakh for service providers in Uttar Pradesh</li>
            <li><strong>Interstate suppliers:</strong> Any Hapur business supplying goods or services to another state — regardless of turnover</li>
            <li><strong>E-commerce sellers:</strong> All sellers on Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, or any online marketplace — mandatory regardless of turnover</li>
            <li><strong>Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM):</strong> Businesses receiving supplies on which they must pay GST under RCM</li>
            <li><strong>Casual taxable persons:</strong> Those making occasional taxable supplies from Hapur</li>
            <li><strong>Agents of registered suppliers</strong> operating in Hapur or surrounding areas</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even if your turnover is below the limit, <strong>voluntary GST registration</strong> is highly advisable for B2B businesses in Hapur — especially if you supply to GST-registered buyers who need to claim ITC on their purchases from you.</p>

        <h2 id="penalty">6. Penalty for Non-Registration</h2>
        <p>Operating without GST registration when mandatory attracts a penalty of <strong>10% of tax due (minimum ₹10,000)</strong>. In cases of deliberate tax evasion, the penalty rises to <strong>100% of the tax amount</strong>. All invoices raised without a GSTIN are invalid — your buyers cannot claim ITC, which often costs you business relationships and contracts.</p>

        <div class="box warn"><p>&#9888;&#65039; <strong>Important:</strong> GST registration is required <em>before</em> making the first taxable supply — not after crossing the turnover threshold. Retrospective registration demands can include penalties and interest on all past taxable supplies. Register early — it's free and protects your business.</p></div>
