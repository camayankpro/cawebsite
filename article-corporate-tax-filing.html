        <p>Every company registered in India — whether a Private Limited Company, Public Limited Company, One Person Company, or a foreign company — is required to file an Income Tax Return each year. Corporate tax compliance is far more structured than individual tax filing and involves multiple forms, deadlines, audit requirements, and regulatory filings. Whether your company operates out of Mumbai, Noida, Bangalore, or Hapur — this guide walks you through corporate tax filing in India comprehensively.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">

        <h2 id="what-is">1. What is Corporate Tax in India?</h2>
        <p>Corporate tax (also called Company Tax) is the tax levied on the net profits of companies registered under the Companies Act, as computed under the Income Tax Act. Every domestic company and foreign company with income accruing in India is liable to pay corporate tax on its profits.</p>
        <p>Corporate tax is a direct tax paid annually by the company on its taxable income. The tax is distinct from GST (which is an indirect tax on transactions). Companies also have TDS obligations, advance tax obligations, and are subject to statutory audit of their accounts before filing the ITR.</p>

        <h2 id="tax-rates">2. Corporate Tax Rates in India</h2>
        <p>The applicable corporate tax rates for domestic companies (before surcharge and cess) are as follows:</p>

        <table class="info-table">
            <tr><th>Category</th><th>Base Tax Rate</th><th>Conditions</th></tr>
            <tr><td>New manufacturing companies (Section 115BAB)</td><td><strong>15%</strong></td><td>Set up and manufacturing commenced on/after 1 October 2019; no other exemptions/incentives claimed</td></tr>
            <tr><td>New domestic companies (Section 115BAA)</td><td><strong>22%</strong></td><td>Opting for concessional rate; no specified exemptions claimed; no MAT applicable</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Other domestic companies — turnover up to ₹400 crore</td><td><strong>25%</strong></td><td>Previous year's total turnover/gross receipts ≤ ₹400 crore</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Other domestic companies — turnover above ₹400 crore</td><td><strong>30%</strong></td><td>Previous year's total turnover/gross receipts > ₹400 crore</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Foreign companies</td><td><strong>40%</strong></td><td>On income accruing or arising in India</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Surcharge:</strong> Applicable at 7% (net income ₹1–10 crore) or 12% (net income above ₹10 crore) for domestic companies. For companies opting for Section 115BAA/115BAB, surcharge is capped at 10%.</p>
        <p><strong>Health & Education Cess:</strong> 4% on tax plus surcharge for all companies.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>🎯 <strong>Choosing the right tax regime for your company</strong> can mean the difference of lakhs in annual tax. Our CA team evaluates your company's profile and recommends the optimal tax structure. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20want%20to%20optimise%20my%20company%27s%20corporate%20tax%20structure" style="color: #3949AB; font-weight: 600;">Optimise my company tax</a></p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="itr6">3. ITR-6 — The Corporate Income Tax Return</h2>
        <p>All companies (domestic and foreign) except those claiming exemption under Section 11 (charitable and religious trusts) must file their Income Tax Return in <strong>Form ITR-6</strong>. Key features of ITR-6:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Must be filed <strong>electronically</strong> using a Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) of a director.</li>
            <li>Includes detailed schedules for profit & loss, balance sheet, capital gains, depreciation, deductions, and tax computation.</li>
            <li>Requires disclosure of related party transactions, details of foreign assets/liabilities, and MSME dues outstanding.</li>
            <li>The return must be accompanied by a statutory audit report (Form 3CA and 3CD for companies requiring tax audit).</li>
            <li>Companies with international transactions must also file Form 3CEB (Transfer Pricing Report) before the ITR.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>📋 <strong>ITR-6 can only be filed after completing the statutory audit</strong> of your company's accounts. Our team handles both statutory audit and ITR-6 filing seamlessly. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20ITR-6%20filing%20and%20statutory%20audit%20services%20for%20my%20company" style="color: #3949AB; font-weight: 600;">Get ITR-6 filed now</a></p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="mat">4. Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT)</h2>
        <p>Companies that enjoy multiple exemptions and deductions often end up with zero or very low taxable income. To ensure such companies pay at least a minimum amount of tax, the Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) provisions under <strong>Section 115JB</strong> apply.</p>

        <h3>How MAT Works:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>MAT is calculated at <strong>15% of Book Profit</strong> (net profit as per Companies Act financial statements, with certain adjustments) plus applicable surcharge and cess.</li>
            <li>If the regular tax liability (computed as per normal provisions) is lower than MAT, the company must pay MAT instead.</li>
            <li>The excess of MAT paid over normal tax is called <strong>MAT Credit</strong>, which can be carried forward and set off against regular tax in subsequent years (up to 15 years).</li>
            <li>Companies opting for Section 115BAA (22% tax regime) and Section 115BAB (15% for new manufacturers) are <strong>exempt from MAT</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>⚠️ <strong>MAT computation errors are one of the most common corporate tax mistakes.</strong> Book profit adjustments require careful analysis. Our CAs compute MAT accurately and track MAT credit for future utilisation. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20MAT%20computation%20and%20corporate%20tax%20services" style="color: #3949AB; font-weight: 600;">Avail our MAT computation service</a></p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="deductions">5. Key Deductions & Allowances for Companies</h2>
        <p>Companies can claim various deductions to reduce their taxable income:</p>

        <h3>Business Expense Deductions (Section 30–37):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rent, repairs, and insurance on business premises and assets.</li>
            <li>Depreciation on plant, machinery, buildings, and intangibles under the block-of-assets method.</li>
            <li>Employees' salaries, provident fund contributions, and ESI contributions.</li>
            <li>Interest on loans borrowed for business purposes.</li>
            <li>Expenditure on scientific research (Section 35) — weighted deduction in certain cases.</li>
            <li>Expenditure on skill development and CSR may have specific treatment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Chapter VI-A Deductions (selected applicable ones):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Section 80G:</strong> Donation to approved charitable institutions (for companies not opting for new tax regime).</li>
            <li><strong>Section 80JJAA:</strong> 30% additional deduction on additional wages paid to new employees in manufacturing for 3 years.</li>
            <li><strong>Section 80IC/80IE:</strong> Profit-linked deductions for units in specified hill states and northeastern states.</li>
            <li><strong>Section 80LA:</strong> Deductions for offshore banking units and IFSC units.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Carry Forward of Losses:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Business losses can be carried forward for <strong>8 years</strong> (condition: ITR filed on time).</li>
            <li>Unabsorbed depreciation can be carried forward <strong>indefinitely</strong>.</li>
            <li>Capital losses: Short-term capital loss can be set off against any capital gain; long-term capital loss only against long-term capital gains — both can be carried forward for 8 years.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="advance-tax">6. Advance Tax for Companies</h2>
        <p>Companies must estimate their annual tax liability and pay it in advance in four instalments:</p>

        <table class="info-table">
            <tr><th>Instalment</th><th>Due Date</th><th>Cumulative % to be Paid</th></tr>
            <tr><td>1st Instalment</td><td>15th June</td><td>At least 15% of estimated annual tax</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2nd Instalment</td><td>15th September</td><td>At least 45% of estimated annual tax</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3rd Instalment</td><td>15th December</td><td>At least 75% of estimated annual tax</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4th Instalment</td><td>15th March</td><td>100% of estimated annual tax</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>Shortfall in advance tax payment attracts interest under Section 234B (1% per month on shortfall) and Section 234C (1% per month per instalment shortfall). Companies should ensure proper advance tax computation to avoid unnecessary interest costs.</p>

        <h2 id="compliance">7. Annual Corporate Tax Compliance Calendar</h2>

        <table class="info-table">
            <tr><th>Compliance</th><th>Form / Document</th><th>Standard Deadline</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Statutory Audit of Accounts</td><td>Audit Report under Companies Act</td><td>Before AGM (typically September 30)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Tax Audit Report</td><td>Form 3CA + Form 3CD</td><td>31st October (assessment year)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Transfer Pricing Report (if applicable)</td><td>Form 3CEB</td><td>31st October (assessment year)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Income Tax Return (ITR-6)</td><td>Filed online with DSC</td><td>31st October (assessment year)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Annual ROC Filing (AOC-4, MGT-7)</td><td>MCA Portal</td><td>Within 60/60 days of AGM</td></tr>
            <tr><td>TDS Returns (quarterly)</td><td>Form 24Q, 26Q, 27Q</td><td>31 days after end of each quarter</td></tr>
            <tr><td>GST Annual Return</td><td>GSTR-9</td><td>31st December (next financial year)</td></tr>
        </table>
