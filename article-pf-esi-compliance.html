        <p>Provident Fund (PF) and Employees' State Insurance (ESI) are two of India's most important employee welfare laws — mandatory for eligible businesses to implement and comply with on a monthly basis. Non-compliance exposes employers to criminal prosecution, heavy penalties, and damage to employee relations. This guide explains PF and ESI applicability, contribution rates, registration, and monthly compliance obligations for businesses across India.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Need PF / ESI registration or monthly compliance?</strong> Our CA team handles PF-ESI registration, monthly challan filing, and annual return for businesses across India. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20PF%20ESI%20registration%20and%20compliance%20for%20my%20business" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="pf">1. Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) — Overview</h2>
        <p>The Employees' Provident Fund is governed by the EPF &amp; Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. It is a retirement savings scheme — a portion of the employee's salary is contributed monthly to a provident fund account, matched by the employer's contribution.</p>

        <h3>EPF Applicability:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mandatory for establishments with <strong>20 or more employees</strong> in most industries</li>
            <li>Once covered, continues to apply even if headcount falls below 20</li>
            <li>Certain industries (construction, beedi, jute, etc.) have lower threshold of 10 employees</li>
            <li>Voluntary coverage available for smaller establishments</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>EPF Contribution Rates:</h3>
        <table class="table">
            <tr><th>Component</th><th>Employee Contribution</th><th>Employer Contribution</th></tr>
            <tr><td>EPF (Employee Provident Fund)</td><td>12% of Basic + DA</td><td>3.67% of Basic + DA</td></tr>
            <tr><td>EPS (Employee Pension Scheme)</td><td>Nil</td><td>8.33% of Basic + DA (max ₹1,250/month)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>EDLI (Employee Deposit Linked Insurance)</td><td>Nil</td><td>0.50% of Basic + DA</td></tr>
            <tr><td>EPF Admin Charges</td><td>Nil</td><td>0.50% of Basic + DA</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>Total employer cost: ~13% of Basic + DA per employee per month. Employee cost: 12% of Basic + DA (deducted from salary).</p>

        <div class="mini-cta"><p>PF contributions must be deposited by the 15th of the following month.

        <h2 id="esi">2. Employees' State Insurance (ESI) — Overview</h2>
        <p>ESI is governed by the ESI Act, 1948 — providing health insurance and social security to employees. Covered employees get medical benefits (free treatment at ESI hospitals and dispensaries), sickness benefit (cash during illness), maternity benefit, disability benefit, and dependent's benefit.</p>

        <h3>ESI Applicability:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mandatory for establishments with <strong>10 or more employees</strong> (20 in some states)</li>
            <li>Applies to employees with monthly wages up to <strong>₹21,000</strong> (₹25,000 for persons with disabilities)</li>
            <li>Employees earning above ₹21,000/month are exempt from ESI</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ESI Contribution Rates:</h3>
        <table class="table">
            <tr><th>Contributor</th><th>Rate</th><th>Calculated On</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Employer Contribution</td><td>3.25% of gross wages</td><td>Monthly gross wages of each eligible employee</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Employee Contribution</td><td>0.75% of gross wages</td><td>Monthly gross wages (deducted from salary)</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>Employees earning up to ₹137/day (₹4,166/month approximately) are exempt from employee ESI contribution — but employer contribution still applies.</p>

        <h2 id="registration">3. PF &amp; ESI Registration Process</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PF Registration:</strong> Online on the EPFO portal (unified.epfo.gov.in) — employer gets a PF Code. Employee UAN (Universal Account Number) allotted for each employee.</li>
            <li><strong>ESI Registration:</strong> Online on the ESIC portal (esic.gov.in) — employer gets ESI Code. Employee and dependent details registered; ESI cards issued.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline for registration:</strong> Must register within 30 days of becoming eligible (crossing headcount threshold)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="monthly">4. Monthly PF &amp; ESI Compliance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PF:</strong> File ECR (Electronic Challan cum Return) on EPFO portal by 15th of following month + deposit challan</li>
