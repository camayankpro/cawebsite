        <p>Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is one of the most widely used mechanisms for tax collection in India. Whether you are an employer, a business owner, a tenant paying rent, or a company making payments to contractors — TDS is part of your financial routine. TDS Returns are the quarterly filings through which deductors report the TDS deducted and deposited to the government. This guide explains everything about TDS Returns — from who needs to file, to the types of returns, due dates, and consequences of non-compliance.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <p>💡 <strong>Struggling with TDS compliance?</strong> Our CA team handles end-to-end TDS management — deduction, challan payment, and quarterly return filing — for businesses and employers across India. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20help%20with%20TDS%20Returns" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Chat with us on WhatsApp</a></p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="what-is">1. What is TDS and Why Are TDS Returns Filed?</h2>
        <p>TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) is a system where the payer of certain income deducts a specified percentage of tax at the time of making the payment, and deposits it with the Government on behalf of the payee. The payee then claims credit for the TDS while filing their Income Tax Return.</p>
        <p>TDS Returns are quarterly statements filed by the deductor (the person or entity that deducted the TDS) with the Income Tax Department. These returns disclose details of every deduction made — who was paid, how much, what TDS rate was applied, and when the TDS was deposited. The data flows into the payee's Form 26AS and Annual Information Statement (AIS), forming the basis for their tax credit claims.</p>

        <h2 id="who-deducts">2. Who Must Deduct TDS and File TDS Returns?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>All Companies and Firms:</strong> Any company (private limited, public limited) or partnership firm making specified payments must deduct TDS.</li>
            <li><strong>Government Offices:</strong> Central and state government departments are mandatory deductors.</li>
            <li><strong>Individuals and HUFs:</strong> Only those whose accounts are subject to audit under Section 44AB in the preceding financial year (i.e., turnover exceeds audit threshold).</li>
            <li><strong>Employers:</strong> Any employer (company, firm, trust, or individual above the audit threshold) paying salary must deduct TDS under Section 192.</li>
            <li><strong>Property Buyers:</strong> Buyers of immovable property valued ₹50 lakh or more must deduct TDS at 1% under Section 194-IA.</li>
            <li><strong>Tenants:</strong> Individuals/HUFs paying rent above ₹50,000 per month must deduct TDS at 5% under Section 194-IB (even if not under audit).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box">
            <p>⚠️ <strong>Getting a TAN is the first step.</strong> Every deductor must obtain a Tax Deduction Account Number (TAN) before deducting TDS. Our team helps obtain TAN and manage all TDS compliance. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20TAN%20registration%20and%20TDS%20compliance%20services" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Apply for TAN now</a></p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Form 16:</strong> Issued by employer to employee — contains salary details and TDS deducted. Must be issued annually by 15th June of the assessment year.</li>
            <li><strong>Form 16A:</strong> Issued for TDS on non-salary payments (interest, professional fees, rent, etc.) — issued quarterly within 15 days from TDS return due date.</li>
