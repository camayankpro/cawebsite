<div class="content">
        <p>A Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) is one of the most powerful and underutilised tax planning tools available exclusively to Hindu, Sikh, Jain, and Buddhist families in India. An HUF is treated as a separate taxpayer — with its own PAN, its own income, and its own tax slab — enabling a family to split income and save substantial income tax legally. Yet most eligible families never form an HUF or form it incorrectly. This guide explains HUF formation, taxation, and how it saves tax.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Want to create an HUF and save income tax legally?</strong> Our CA team creates HUF deeds, obtains HUF PAN, advises on optimal income structuring, and files HUF ITRs for families across India. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20want%20to%20form%20an%20HUF%20for%20tax%20planning" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Send an Enquiry &#8594;</a></div>

        <h2 id="what-is">1. What is an HUF?</h2>
        <p>A Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) is a separate legal entity under the Income Tax Act — an automatic body of persons created by the birth of a family. Any Hindu male individual who is married automatically becomes a Karta (head) of an HUF with his wife and children as its members. Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists are also eligible to form HUFs under the Act. An HUF files a separate ITR, has a separate PAN, and pays income tax independently from its members at applicable slab rates.</p>

        <h2 id="tax-saving">2. How HUF Saves Tax</h2>
        <p>The key tax saving comes from <strong>income splitting</strong>. Without an HUF, all family income is taxed in the hands of the earning member — potentially at 30%. With an HUF:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The HUF gets its own <strong>basic exemption</strong> (₹2.5 lakh under old regime / ₹3 lakh under new regime)</li>
            <li>The HUF gets its own <strong>Section 80C deduction</strong> (up to ₹1.5 lakh)</li>
            <li>Income earned from HUF assets is taxed in the HUF's hands at lower slab rates — not at the Karta's individual rate</li>
            <li>A family with income split between individual (₹15 lakh) and HUF (₹5 lakh) pays significantly less tax than a single taxpayer with ₹20 lakh income</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="mini-cta"><p>A family can save ₹50,000–₹2 lakh or more in annual income tax by properly structuring income through an HUF.

        <h2 id="formation">3. How to Form an HUF</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HUF Deed:</strong> Draft and execute an HUF Deed — a legal document declaring the HUF, its members (Karta, co-parceners, members), and the corpus (initial capital contributed)</li>
            <li><strong>HUF PAN:</strong> Apply for a separate PAN for the HUF — in the name "[Karta's Name] HUF"</li>
            <li><strong>HUF Bank Account:</strong> Open a current or savings account in the HUF's name using the HUF PAN and HUF Deed</li>
            <li><strong>Corpus Creation:</strong> Transfer some assets or funds to the HUF as gifts from family members or through ancestral property income — this creates the HUF's income-earning base</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An HUF is most powerful when it has genuine income-generating assets — ancestral property, business income, investments, or rental income channelled through the HUF.</p>

        <h2 id="what-income">4. What Income Can the HUF Have?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rental income</strong> from ancestral or HUF-owned property</li>
            <li><strong>Business income</strong> from a business run in the HUF's name</li>
            <li><strong>Interest income</strong> from investments made from HUF corpus</li>
            <li><strong>Capital gains</strong> from sale of HUF assets</li>
            <li><strong>Agricultural income</strong> from ancestral land (exempt, but reduces effective tax rate)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What cannot be transferred to HUF:</strong> Self-earned income of the Karta cannot be transferred to the HUF — this would be a tax evasion. Income that is genuinely earned or received by the HUF as an entity is what qualifies.</p>

        <h2 id="compliance">5. HUF Compliance Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Annual ITR filing (ITR-2 for HUF with capital gains; ITR-3 if HUF has business income)</li>
            <li>Advance tax payment if tax liability exceeds ₹10,000 in a year</li>
            <li>GST registration if HUF business turnover crosses the threshold</li>
            <li>TDS deduction if HUF is paying rent above ₹50,000/month, professional fees, etc.</li>
            <li>Books of accounts maintenance if business income</li>
        </ul>
