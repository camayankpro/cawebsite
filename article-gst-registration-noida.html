        <h2 id="who-needs">1. Who Must Register for GST in Noida?</h2>
        <p>As per the GST Act, 2017, the following businesses in Noida must mandatorily register for GST:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Turnover threshold:</strong> Annual turnover above ₹40 lakh for goods suppliers; above ₹20 lakh for service providers in Uttar Pradesh</li>
            <li><strong>E-commerce sellers:</strong> All sellers on Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Meesho — mandatory regardless of turnover</li>
            <li><strong>Interstate suppliers:</strong> Noida businesses supplying to Delhi, Gurugram, Mumbai, or any other state — regardless of turnover</li>
            <li><strong>IT &amp; software exporters (Sector 62, 63):</strong> Must register to file LUT and claim zero-rated status on service exports</li>
            <li><strong>Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM):</strong> Businesses receiving specified supplies on which they must pay GST under RCM</li>
            <li><strong>Input Service Distributors (ISD)</strong> and businesses liable for TDS/TCS under GST</li>
            <li><strong>Importers and exporters</strong> using Noida's logistics infrastructure</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For Noida's large startup and freelancer community: even below the threshold, <strong>voluntary GST registration</strong> is strongly advised — most corporate clients and MNCs in Noida's IT parks only engage with GST-registered vendors.</p>

        <h2 id="penalty">7. Penalty for Non-Registration</h2>
        <p>Operating without GST registration when mandatory attracts a penalty of <strong>10% of tax due (minimum ₹10,000)</strong>. For deliberate evasion: <strong>100% of the tax amount</strong>. In Noida's B2B-heavy corporate ecosystem, unregistered suppliers are routinely disqualified by corporate procurement teams — making non-registration a direct business risk beyond just the penalty.</p>

        <div class="box warn"><p>&#9888;&#65039; <strong>For Noida startups and new businesses:</strong> GST registration is required <em>before</em> your first taxable supply — not after crossing the turnover threshold. Retroactive registration demands can include penalties on all past supplies. Register early — it is free and opens doors to larger clients.</p></div>

        <h2 id="faq">8. Frequently Asked Questions — GST Registration in Noida</h2>
        <p><strong>Q: What is the GST threshold for service providers in Noida?</strong><br>Service providers in Noida (Uttar Pradesh) must register if annual turnover exceeds ₹20 lakh. For goods suppliers, the limit is ₹40 lakh. Certain categories like e-commerce sellers must register regardless of turnover.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Can a Noida startup register for GST with a virtual office address?</strong><br>Yes. A virtual office address is accepted. You need an NOC from the virtual office provider and the premises' electricity bill. Our team regularly handles this for Noida startups.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Which GST commissionerate covers Noida?</strong><br>Noida (Gautam Buddha Nagar) falls under the <strong>CGST Commissionerate, Noida</strong>, under the Meerut Zone. SGST is administered by the UP Government's Commercial Tax Department.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: I am a freelancer in Noida working for foreign clients. Do I need GST registration?</strong><br>If you export services (invoice foreign clients in foreign currency), registration is mandatory but your services are zero-rated — meaning no GST is charged. Filing an LUT annually allows you to export without paying GST. Our team handles this end-to-end.</p>
