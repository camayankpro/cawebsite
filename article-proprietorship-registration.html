    <div class="content">
        <p>The Sole Proprietorship is the simplest and most common form of business in India — a business owned and operated by a single individual, with no legal distinction between the owner and the business. Millions of small businesses, traders, freelancers, and professionals across India operate as proprietorships. While starting a proprietorship requires no formal registration under a specific "Proprietorship Act," certain registrations are essential for opening a bank account, GST compliance, and business operations. This guide explains everything about proprietorship registration and compliance in India.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Starting a business as a sole proprietor?</strong> Our CA team helps you get all required registrations — GST, MSME/Udyam, Shop Act, PAN linking, and bank account — to establish your proprietorship correctly from day one. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20want%20to%20register%20a%20Proprietorship%20business" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">Chat with us on WhatsApp</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="what-is">1. What is a Sole Proprietorship?</h2>
        <p>A Sole Proprietorship is a business owned and run by one individual where there is no legal distinction between the owner and the business. All profits belong to the proprietor, all liabilities are personally borne by the proprietor, and all business assets are personally owned. There is no separate legal entity — the proprietor IS the business.</p>
        <p>This is the simplest business structure in India — requiring minimal formalities and no separate registration law. However, it comes with unlimited personal liability — if the business incurs debts it cannot pay, the owner's personal assets can be seized by creditors.</p>

        <h2 id="registrations">2. Key Registrations for a Proprietorship</h2>
        <p>While there is no single "Proprietorship Registration," the following registrations establish and legitimise your business:</p>

        <h3>GST Registration:</h3>
        <p>Mandatory if turnover exceeds ₹40 lakh (goods) or ₹20 lakh (services) — or lower for certain states/categories. Even below the threshold, voluntary GST registration is advisable for B2B businesses (suppliers/customers require GSTIN for ITC). GST registration in the proprietor's name with the business trade name provides official identity to the business.</p>

        <h3>MSME / Udyam Registration:</h3>
        <p>Udyam Registration is the official recognition for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises on the government's Udyam portal. It is free, online, and self-certified — based on PAN and GST data. Benefits include priority sector lending from banks, protection under MSMED Act (45-day payment rule), government tender preferences, and subsidised interest rates.</p>

        <h3>Shop and Establishment Act Registration:</h3>
        <p>Most states require businesses operating from commercial premises to register under the respective state's Shops and Establishments Act. This is essential for employee compliance, labour inspections, and bank account opening. Requirements vary by state — our team handles this for Uttar Pradesh and other states.</p>

        <h3>Current Account Opening:</h3>
        <p>Banks require specific documents to open a current account in the business/trade name for a proprietorship — typically GST certificate or Udyam certificate, Shop Act licence, and proprietor's KYC. Our team helps compile the correct document set for your bank.</p>

        <h3>Import Export Code (IEC):</h3>
        <p>If the proprietorship engages in import or export of goods or services, IEC from DGFT is required.</p>

        <h2 id="advantages">3. Advantages and Disadvantages of Proprietorship</h2>
        <table class="info-table">
            <tr><th>Advantages</th><th>Disadvantages</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Simplest to start — no complex registration</td><td>Unlimited personal liability</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Complete control by owner</td><td>No separate legal identity — cannot sue in business name</td></tr>
            <tr><td>All profits to owner</td><td>Difficult to raise equity capital</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Minimal compliance costs</td><td>Business ceases on death of proprietor</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Taxed at individual slab rates — beneficial at low income</td><td>Less credibility than Pvt Ltd or LLP</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h2 id="taxation">4. Taxation of Proprietorship</h2>
        <p>A proprietorship is not a separate tax entity — the business income is taxed in the hands of the proprietor as part of their individual income tax return (ITR-3 for business income). This means business profits are added to the proprietor's total income and taxed at the applicable slab rates (up to 30% for income above ₹10 lakh). The new tax regime (lower slab rates with fewer deductions) vs old regime choice applies here as well.</p>

        <h2 id="when-upgrade">5. When to Graduate from Proprietorship to LLP or Pvt Ltd</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When turnover crosses ₹1–2 crore — tax audit triggers and liability exposure grows</li>
            <li>When seeking significant bank loans — banks prefer corporate structures</li>
            <li>When wanting to bring in partners or investors</li>
            <li>When personal liability exposure becomes a concern (dealing with large contracts)</li>
            <li>When brand credibility requires corporate recognition</li>
        </ul>
