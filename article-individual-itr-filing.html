        <p>Filing your Income Tax Return (ITR) is one of the most important financial responsibilities for every individual in India. Whether you are a salaried employee in Mumbai, a freelancer in Bengaluru, a professional in Delhi, or a business person in Hapur — understanding ITR filing helps you stay compliant, claim rightful refunds, and build a strong financial profile. This guide covers everything an individual needs to know about ITR filing in India.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>💡 <strong>File Your ITR Without Stress!</strong> Our CA experts handle ITR filing for individuals across India — salaried, freelancers, NRIs, investors and more. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20help%20with%20my%20Individual%20ITR%20Filing" style="color: #3949AB; font-weight: 600;">Chat with us on WhatsApp</a> for quick, hassle-free filing.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="what-is">1. What is ITR Filing?</h2>
        <p>Income Tax Return (ITR) filing is the process by which an individual declares their total income earned during a financial year to the Income Tax Department of India and pays the applicable tax on it. It is an annual obligation and serves as an official record of your earnings, taxes paid, and tax-saving investments.</p>
        <p>The Income Tax Department processes your return and either raises a demand (if more tax is due) or issues a refund (if excess tax has been deducted). Filing an accurate return on time ensures you stay on the right side of the law and also gives you access to several financial benefits.</p>

        <h2 id="who-must">2. Who Must File ITR?</h2>
        <p>While tax payment is mandatory above certain income levels, ITR filing is required in a wider set of circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Income Exceeds Basic Exemption:</strong> Individuals with total income exceeding the basic exemption limit (currently ₹2.5 lakh under old regime; ₹3 lakh under new regime for individuals below 60 years) must file.</li>
            <li><strong>Senior Citizens (60–79 years):</strong> Basic exemption of ₹3 lakh (old regime); super senior citizens (80+) get ₹5 lakh.</li>
            <li><strong>Foreign Asset Holders:</strong> Any resident individual holding foreign assets or having signing authority in foreign accounts must file, regardless of income level.</li>
            <li><strong>Refund Claimants:</strong> If TDS has been deducted on your income and you want a refund, filing is mandatory.</li>
            <li><strong>High-Value Transactions:</strong> Depositing more than ₹1 crore in a current account, spending ₹2 lakh+ on foreign travel, or electricity bill exceeding ₹1 lakh triggers mandatory filing.</li>
            <li><strong>Business or Profession Income:</strong> All individuals earning from business or profession must file.</li>
            <li><strong>Capital Gains:</strong> Any individual with capital gains from shares, mutual funds, property, etc., must file.</li>
            <li><strong>Carry Forward of Losses:</strong> To carry forward losses (capital, business, etc.) to future years, filing is compulsory.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>⚠️ <strong>Even if your income is below the taxable limit,</strong> filing ITR is advisable — it acts as a crucial financial document for loan applications, visa processing, and government tenders. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20want%20to%20know%20if%20I%20need%20to%20file%20ITR" style="color: #3949AB; font-weight: 600;">Ask our experts for free</a></p>

        <h2 id="itr-forms">3. Choosing the Right ITR Form</h2>
        <p>Choosing the wrong ITR form can lead to defective return notices. Here is a quick guide:</p>

        <table class="info-table">
            <tr><th>ITR Form</th><th>Applicable For</th><th>Key Exclusions</th></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>ITR-1 (Sahaj)</strong></td><td>Salaried individuals, one house property, other sources; total income up to ₹50 lakh</td><td>Business income, capital gains, foreign assets</td></tr>

        </table>

        </div>

        <h2 id="deadlines">6. Filing Deadlines & Penalties for Late Filing</h2>
        <p>ITR filing deadlines are fixed each year by the Income Tax Department. While the exact dates may vary year to year due to government extensions, the standard deadlines for a financial year ending March 31 are:</p>

        </ul>

            <li><strong>Loan Applications:</strong> Banks and NBFCs require ITR for 2–3 years for home loans, personal loans, and business loans.</li>
            <li><strong>Visa Processing:</strong> Most embassies require ITR copies as proof of financial standing.</li>
            <li><strong>Government Tenders:</strong> Many tenders require ITR proof for eligibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance Coverage:</strong> Higher insurance coverage often requires ITR as income proof.</li>
            <li><strong>Carry Forward of Losses:</strong> Losses (short-term capital, long-term capital, business) can be set off against future gains.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance Shield:</strong> Protects you from scrutiny notices and penalty proceedings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="common-mistakes">8. Common Mistakes to Avoid in ITR Filing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wrong ITR Form:</strong> Always match your income sources to the correct form — filing the wrong form makes your return defective.</li>
            <li><strong>Not Reporting All Income:</strong> Interest from savings, FDs, and post office accounts, dividends, and rental income must all be disclosed.</li>
            <li><strong>Mismatch with Form 26AS / AIS:</strong> Any mismatch between your return and Form 26AS can trigger a notice.</li>
            <li><strong>Forgetting Employer PAN:</strong> For salaried individuals, entering the correct employer TAN/PAN is essential.</li>
            <li><strong>Missing Foreign Income / Assets:</strong> Not disclosing foreign income or assets attracts penalties under Black Money Act.</li>
            <li><strong>Not Verifying the Return:</strong> An ITR is not complete until it is e-verified. Unverified returns are treated as not filed.</li>
            <li><strong>Choosing Wrong Tax Regime:</strong> Not evaluating old vs. new regime before filing can cost you significant tax savings.</li>
        </ul>
