        <p>Input Tax Credit (ITC) is the most powerful feature of GST — it prevents cascading taxation by allowing businesses to offset the GST they paid on purchases against the GST they collect on sales. A well-managed ITC process can save businesses lakhs in tax every year. But ITC rules are complex, conditions are strict, and wrong ITC claims can attract heavy demands and penalties. This guide explains ITC — who can claim it, what conditions apply, what is blocked, and how to maximise legitimate ITC.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>&#128161; <strong>Missing ITC or over-claiming it?</strong> Our CA team conducts ITC audits, GSTR-2B reconciliation, and monthly ITC management for businesses across India. <a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20ITC%20management%20and%20reconciliation%20services" style="color:#3949AB;font-weight:600;">WhatsApp our CA team &#8594;</a></p></div>

        <h2 id="what-is">1. What is Input Tax Credit (ITC)?</h2>
        <p>When you buy goods or services for your business and pay GST to your supplier, that GST paid is your Input Tax Credit. You can use this ITC to reduce the GST payable on your sales. <strong>Example:</strong> You bought raw materials worth ₹10 lakh + ₹1.8 lakh GST. You sold finished goods for ₹15 lakh + ₹2.7 lakh GST. Your net GST payable = ₹2.7L – ₹1.8L = ₹90,000 (not ₹2.7 lakh). You saved ₹1.8 lakh — that's the power of ITC.</p>

        <h2 id="conditions">2. Conditions for Claiming ITC</h2>
        <p>All five conditions below must be satisfied simultaneously:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You are a <strong>registered GST taxpayer</strong> (not composition scheme)</li>
            <li>You possess a valid <strong>tax invoice or debit note</strong> from a GST-registered supplier</li>
            <li>You have <strong>received the goods or services</strong> (for installment purchases, ITC allowed as each installment is received)</li>
            <li>Your supplier has <strong>filed their GSTR-1</strong> and the invoice reflects in your <strong>GSTR-2B</strong></li>
            <li>You have <strong>paid your GST tax liability</strong> (ITC cannot be claimed if your own returns are pending)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From October 2022, ITC can only be claimed to the extent reflected in GSTR-2B — provisional ITC claims are no longer permitted.</p>

        <div class="mini-cta"><p>Suppliers not filing GSTR-1 on time blocks your ITC. Our team tracks your vendor compliance and follows up on missing ITC.</p><a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20vendor%20GST%20compliance%20tracking%20and%20ITC%20recovery%20help">Track My ITC &#8594;</a></div>

        <h2 id="blocked">3. Blocked ITC — Section 17(5)</h2>
        <p>Section 17(5) blocks ITC on specific categories even if all conditions are met:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Motor vehicles</strong> (cars, bikes) for personal use — ITC blocked; vehicles used for transportation of goods/passengers or further supply are eligible</li>
            <li><strong>Food, beverages, outdoor catering</strong> — blocked (unless you're in the food business)</li>
            <li><strong>Beauty treatment, health services, cosmetic surgery</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Membership of clubs, health and fitness centres</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Travel benefits to employees</strong> (leave travel, home travel concession)</li>
            <li><strong>Works contract services for construction of immovable property</strong> (own building)</li>
            <li><strong>Goods or services for personal consumption</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Goods lost, stolen, destroyed, or gifted</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="reversal">4. ITC Reversal — When You Must Give Back ITC</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-payment to supplier within 180 days:</strong> If you don't pay your supplier within 180 days of invoice date, ITC claimed must be reversed with interest. Reclaimed when paid.</li>
            <li><strong>Exempt supplies (Rule 42/43):</strong> If your business makes both taxable and exempt supplies, ITC must be reversed in proportion to exempt supply value.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit note from supplier:</strong> When your supplier issues a credit note — deduct the corresponding ITC.</li>
            <li><strong>Capital goods sold or disposed:</strong> Proportionate ITC reversal on the useful life remaining.</li>
            <li><strong>GSTR-2B mismatch:</strong> ITC claimed in GSTR-3B but not in GSTR-2B must be reversed or explained.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="mini-cta"><p>ITC reversals due to 180-day rule violations are a common source of GST demands. Our team tracks supplier payment timelines and prevents surprise reversals.</p><a href="https://wa.me/919045222870?text=Hello!%20I%20need%20ITC%20reversal%20tracking%20and%20management%20services">Manage ITC Reversals &#8594;</a></div>

        <h2 id="gstr2b">5. GSTR-2B — The ITC Control Document</h2>
        <p>GSTR-2B is the auto-generated monthly ITC statement — showing all ITC available based on your suppliers' GSTR-1 filings. It is static (does not change after generation) and is the authoritative basis for ITC claims from Oct 2022. Before filing GSTR-3B each month, reconcile your purchase register with GSTR-2B — claim only what appears in GSTR-2B, investigate what's missing, and reverse what should not have been claimed.</p>

        <h2 id="annual">6. Annual ITC Reconciliation for GSTR-9</h2>
        <p>In the Annual GST Return (GSTR-9), all ITC claimed during the year must be reconciled with GSTR-2B annual data and the financial statements. Excess ITC claimed must be reversed. Unclaimed eligible ITC (missed during the year) can be claimed in GSTR-9 up to the due date of GSTR-9 for that year.</p>
